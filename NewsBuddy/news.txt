North Korea has fired an an intercontinental ballistic missile which may have landed in Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), according to the country's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

The zone reaches 200 nautical miles from the country's coast. Mr Abe has called an emergency meeting of the National Security Council.

"I have received information that North Korea once again conducted a missile firing," Mr Abe said. "We will immediately analyze information and do our utmost to protect the safety of the Japanese people."

He called on the US, South Korea, Russia and China to increase pressure on the secretive state over its missile launches, which have defied international rulings.

Trump on North Korea: There are consequences for their bad behaviour

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan "absolutely cannot tolerate" repeated provocations from North Korea, also known as the DPRK.

Soon after reports of the launch emerged from Japan, the Pentagon and South Korean military officials confirmed they detected a ballistic missile launch from North Korea.

On Friday evening, Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said: "The US Department of Defence detected and tracked a single North Korea missile launch today. We assess that this missile was an intercontinental ballistic missile, as had been expected.

"The missile was launched from Mupyong-ni and travelled about 1,000km before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. We are working with our interagency partners on a more detailed assessment.

"The North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.

"Our commitment to the defence of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad. We are prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation."

Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis said the lengthy flight time meant the missile was likely a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), potentially capable of travelling 10,000km and hitting a target in the US.

According to Yonhap news agency, South Korean military officials said the missile was launched from Jagang Province, in the north of the DPRK.

South Korea has also called a national security meeting.

The night time launch of the ICBM was unusual, as most take place around dawn. Dr. John Nilsson-Wright, senior research fellow on Chatham House's Asia programme, told The Independent this could have been to demonstrate the military was capable of launching in varying conditions.

Alternatively, Dr Nilsson-Wright said, "maybe the element of surprise is part of the reason why they wanted to do this".

He added: "I think they've shown that they have the capability, the increased technical sophistication, and I think there will be a lot of anxiety in Seoul and Tokyo."

It comes just one day after the 64th anniversary of the end of the Korean War -- known as Victory Day in the North.

International tensions have been mounting over the nuclear ambitions of North Korea in recent months, and Donald Trump has threatened to "take care" of the unstable situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Just over two years after candidate Donald Trump mocked John McCain's Vietnam War record, noting that he prefers heroes "who weren't captured", the Arizona senator stuck a dagger in President Trump's healthcare reform plans.

There were gasps when Mr McCain, after being furiously lobbied by Vice-President Mike Pence, joined two other Republican senators in voting against the so-called "skinny" repeal plan, considered the bare minimum Senate Republicans could agree on.

Instead of a big step toward becoming law - either in its skinny form or after further negotiations with the House of Representatives - the future of Obamacare repeal has been thrown into doubt.

The reality is, for now, there is no minimum level of change on which Senate Republicans can agree. They either have to work with Democrats or resign themselves to stalemate and move on to other topics, like taxes or infrastructure spending.

It will take some time for the scale of this late-night Senate drama to sink in. No one really expected Mr McCain to be the decisive vote, but the man who once had a reputation as a Republican "maverick", now facing a dire brain cancer diagnosis, had at least one more surprise in his pocket.

What was the 'skinny repeal'?

The bill - officially known as the Health Care Freedom Act - would have eliminated parts of Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act - including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage or pay a fine, and the employer mandate, which requires the same of companies with 50 employees or more.

It also would have temporarily repealed a tax on medical devices, defund the US women's group Planned Parenthood for a year and provide more money to community health centres, as well as given states more flexibility in complying with Obamacare regulations.

But the pared-down measure would have left much of Obamacare untouched, including the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for the poor that faced deep cuts in earlier proposals.

A requirement that all insurance plans cover essential health benefits, federal subsidies to help consumers pay for insurance as well as taxes on wealthy Americans also would have remained in place.

The stripped down bill came after earlier Senate defeats for proposals to replace Obamacare and then to partially repeal it.

Sen McCain said he had voted against the skinny repeal because it did not amount to meaningful reform and would not have improved care for Americans.

He added that House Speaker Paul Ryan's assurance that the House would be willing to send the bill for further consideration by committee "did not ease my concern that this shell of a bill could be taken up and passed at any time".

What now for Obamacare?

There are not thought to be any further plans for a new bill to repeal Obamacare because the skinny repeal was seen as the only measure Republicans could get through Congress.

However, lawmakers could revive the issue and take it up later in the year.

Following the vote, President Trump tweeted: "As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal."

Media caption'Trump not thinking about the little people'

Mr Trump's position on healthcare reform has varied - he has spoken out at various points for Obamacare being repealed, repealed and replaced, or being allowed to collapse by itself.

In his statement, Mr McCain said Obamacare was in a state of "collapse", with healthcare premiums "skyrocketing" and providers "fleeing the marketplace".

He criticised the way Obamacare had been passed by Democrats using their Obama-era majority and called for senators to "return to the correct way of legislating" with input from both parties.

"We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) project called “Imperial” included three hacking tools for infiltrating the Mac and Linux operating systems, according to the latest “Vault 7” leaks.

Cyber security in the Middle East

It is not just western countries such as the US and the UK that are being targeted by hackers, as the rapidly developed and wealthy nations of the Middle East become targets of both politically and financially driven attacks. Discover how cyber security expertise can help businesses in the Middle East navigate digital transformations and keep cyber criminals at bay.

WikiLeaks claims that a source provided portions of an archive of the CIA’s hacking arsenal, including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponised “zero day” exploits and malware remote control systems that was circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorised manner.

The latest documents to be leaked detail hacking tools called Achilles, Aeris and SeaPea.

According to the documents, Achilles is aimed at enabling CIA agents to “trojan an [Mac] OS X disk image (.dmg) installer with one or more desired operator specified executables for a one-time execution”.

SeaPea is designed to function as a Mac OS X rootkit for versions 10.6 and 10.7 to allow CIA agents to infiltrate a system while it reboots to carry out monitoring operations and launch tools.

SeaPea’s manual was previously released by WikiLeaks in another Vault 7 release named DarkSeaSkies, which detailed hacking tools targeting Macs and iPhones.

Aeris is described as an automated implant written in the C programming language that targets Linux distributions, including Debian, Red Hat, Solaris, FreeBSD and CentOS.

The documents claim Aeris is designed to function as a backdoor to these Linux distributions and can be used to build customised implants tailored for specific operations.

There is a lot of “fog” surrounding cyber weapons and cyber war because there is no way of knowing the true capability of any country, says security expert Mikko Hypponen.

Aeris supports “automated file exfiltration, configurable beacon interval and jitter, standalone and Collide-based HTTPS LP support and SMTP protocol support – all with TLS encrypted communications with mutual authentication”, according to WikiLeaks.

WikiLeaks says the documents indicate the scope of the CIA’s global covert hacking programme, its malware arsenal and dozens of “zero day” weaponised exploits against a wide range of US and European company products.

WikiLeaks claims that since 2001, the CIA has gained political and budgetary pre-eminence over the US National Security Agency (NSA) and built its own group of hackers.

By the end of 2016, says WikiLeaks, the CIA’s hacking division had more than 5,000 registered users and had produced more than 1,000 hacking systems, trojans, viruses and other “weaponised” malware, creating, in effect, its “own NSA” but with “even less accountability”.

WikiLeaks said the source of the Vault 7 leaks suggested there were policy questions that urgently needed to be debated in public, including whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.

“The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons,” said WikiLeaks.

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo and Co said it would reimburse about $80 million to 570,000 customers who may have been charged wrongly due to issues related to auto collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies.

Wells Fargo has been engulfed in scandal since September, when it reached a $190 million settlement with regulators over complaints that its retail banking staff had opened as many as 2.1 million unauthorized client accounts.

The bank had fired 5,300 employees for improper sales tactics over five years, but did not make much changes to policies and procedures, or hold managers accountable until there was a public outcry.

Wells Fargo said late Thursday it would pay back $80 million to customers wrongly charged for car loan insurance in the coming months, which included $64 million in cash and $16 million of account adjustments.

"We take full responsibility for our failure to appropriately manage the CPI program and are extremely sorry for any harm this caused our customers," said Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo Consumer Lending.

The bank said it had started a review of the CPI program in July 2016 and discontinued the program in September, based on the findings.

New York Times reported earlier that more than 800,000 people who took car loans from Wells Fargo were charged for auto insurance they did not need, and some of the customers were still paying for it. nyti.ms/2tIdyUE

About 490,000 customers had duplicate vehicle insurance coverage and about 60,000 customers did not receive complete disclosures from vendors, prior to CPI coverage, Wells Fargo said.

For about 20,000 customers, additional costs of the CPI could have led to defaults resulting in seizure of their vehicles. The bank said these customers would receive additional payments as compensation for the loss of their vehicles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will explore cutting the level of nicotine in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels, a radical step that would reshape the $130 billion American tobacco industry and potentially encourage millions of people to quit smoking.

The move, announced Friday, would represent one of the most sweeping federal efforts to reduce smoking since Congress required cigarette packages to carry health warnings in 1965. It follows other moves by President Donald Trump’s FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to try and deal with the high cost of prescription drugs and opioid addiction, two issues not directly within the agency’s traditional mandate.

Tobacco stocks plunged after the announcement, which came just hours after the failure of Republicans’ effort to repeal and replace much of the Affordable Care Act. The FDA’s move is likely to set off a lobbying fight in Washington, even as it pushes the industry to move faster in the development of new products that rely less on burning tobacco and more on potentially lower-risk technologies like vaping.

“The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes -- the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users,” Gottlieb said in a statement announcing the move. “Unless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.”

Gottlieb also said regulators will look at banning menthol and flavored-products because of their potential for attracting young people. An administration official said the White House supports the move, and disagreed that it was a break from Trump’s anti-regulation agenda.

Tobacco Innovation

In a briefing Friday, he called nicotine both the “problem” and “ultimately, the solution.” Along with nicotine reduction, the FDA plans to ease the path of entry for less-harmful nicotine delivery systems. The FDA “must also recognize potential for innovation to lead to less harmful products,” Gottlieb said in the briefing.

“I’ve pledged a deep commitment to taking aggressive steps to address the epidemic of addiction to opioids,” Gottlieb said. “I view our opportunity to confront addiction to nicotine with the same obligation. I’ll pursue efforts to reduce addiction to nicotine with the same vigor.”

While reducing nicotine is bad news for the cigarette business, the impact could be tempered for companies like Philip Morris International Inc. and Altria Group Inc., which have been putting more emphasis on innovations they say have less health risks. Philip Morris has spent over $3 billion on developing its reduced-risk portfolio.

“This was a big surprise and will make it imperative that domestic tobacco companies strive to develop innovative, safer products,” said Jack Russo, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. who follows the tobacco industry.

Shares of Altria dropped as much as 19 percent, the biggest intraday decline since 1999. British American Tobacco’s stock fell as much as 14 percent.

“Until the eventual development of specific proposals, it’s too early to understand the practical implications,” said Simon Evans, a spokesman for Imperial Brands Plc, a Bristol, U.K.-based tobacco manufacturer that sells Winston and Kool cigarettes. Shares of the company fell as much as 9.5 percent.

Unexpected

The move caught some in Washington by surprise. Representative Robert Aderholt, the Alabama Republican who runs the congressional subcommittee overseeing the FDA budget, said Gottlieb called earlier in the day to give him a heads up on the new policy.

“I’m still trying to get my arms around it,” said Aderholt.

The Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-smoking advocacy group that’s been active in past tobacco regulatory changes, said it didn’t get a preview of the announcement. Staff were gathered in a conference room watching Gottlieb’s announcement when they got the news, Becky Wexler, a spokeswoman, said via email.

FDA Authority

The FDA gained oversight of tobacco products in 2009 through the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The law said that agency had “the authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other harmful components of tobacco products.”

Developing regulations around the proposal will take time, and is likely to create fierce debate.

“The FDA plans to begin a public dialogue about lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to nonaddictive levels through achievable product standards,” the agency said in the announcement.

Representatives of Philip Morris and Altria didn’t respond to requests for comment. British American Tobacco’s Reynolds American division said it was encouraged by the move and that the FDA had recognized “tobacco harm reduction policies and the continuum of risk for tobacco products.”

Sales of cigarettes have already been in decline, hurt in part by rising taxes. The industry’s cigarette sales volume dropped an estimated 4.5 percent last quarter, Altria reported earlier this week. The average state excise tax was $1.74 per pack last quarter, compared with 19 cents for the same time last year, according to Altria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A congressional information technology staffer was arrested Monday evening before a scheduled flight for Lahore, Pakistan, and charged with bank fraud in connection with a $165,000 loan from the congressional Federal Credit Union, authorities said.

Imran Awan, 37, pleaded not guilty Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey in Washington and was released to a high-intensity supervision program whose conditions include GPS monitoring, a nighttime curfew and staying within a 50-mile radius of his home in Lorton, federal prosecutors said. He was arrested at Dulles International Airport, his attorney said.

Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, allegedly secured a $165,000 home equity loan in January from CFCU on a house in Alexandria after claiming it was their primary residence, when it was a rental property, FBI Special Agent Brandon C. Merriman wrote in an affidavit for Awan’s arrest. The couple told the credit union to wire the money to Pakistan for use in purchasing a property, Merriman wrote.

Alvi, also a former House IT worker, and the couple’s three school-aged children, were approached by federal agents but allowed to board a flight to Lahore on March 5 Merriman wrote, but he said that he “does not believe that Alvi has any intention to return to the United States.”

Awan’s attorney, Chris Gowen, said in a statement, “Because we are confident in the integrity of the U.S. justice system, we are confident that Mr. Awan will soon be able to clear his name and get on with his life. Neither Mr. Awan nor his wife have ever had any intention to ‘flee’ the United States.”

“They are U.S. citizens who have built a full life and have a strong community life in this country. They will stand and fight whatever charges are presented,” Gowen said. The couple had round trip tickets, and Awan had informed the government of his plans to travel, Gowen said.

Awan had worked for the House since 2004 as a shared employee, getting paid about $165,000 per year from about a dozen Democratic members in 2015 and 2016, for example, according to Legistorm. Most payments ended by early February, the congressional data tracking service reported.

Awan worked most recently for U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), before he was fired Tuesday, her spokesman said.

“Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,” David Damron said.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office of the District and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Capitol Police declined to comment, citing the pending case.

Border officers appeared to encourage teen to drink from bottle containing liquid meth

A government surveillance video obtained by ABC News has shed new light on a tragic incident at the U.S.-Mexico border, sparking outrage from members of Congress who help oversee U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The video shows that in 2013 two U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers appeared to encourage, or at least permit, a 16-year-old Mexican high school student to drink from a bottle that tests would later reveal contained concentrated liquid methamphetamine.

The young man, Cruz Velazquez, died within two hours of drinking the substance, but the two officers involved, Valerie Baird and Adrian Perallon, remain on the job today, with no disciplinary action taken against them.

A former head of internal affairs at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, James Tomsheck, told ABC News the two officers violated agency protocols by allowing the young man to drink from the bottle, and that he was told at the time they would be punished.

"If they truly suspected there was a controlled substance in the bottle," Tomsheck said, "they should've conducted a field test."

Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California and the ranking member on the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, condemned the officers' conduct.

"Drug smuggling is wrong and is a crime, but this teenage boy did not deserve a death sentence," Lofgren told ABC News. "For CBP officers to inflict a summary death sentence is not only immoral, but also illegal."

Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Missouri and the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, echoed those sentiments.

"In order for CBP officers to prevent smuggling, ensure public safety, and do their difficult job at the border properly, CBP must have the appropriate protocols in place and officers must follow them," Thompson told ABC News. "While there is no excuse for attempting to bring illicit substances into the country, it is absolutely clear from the video that there were numerous failures in judgement and procedure that led to the senseless death of a 16-year-old boy. CBP must ensure that such a tragedy never occurs again."

The video, which will air for the first time today on Good Morning America, World News Tonight with David Muir, 20/20 and Nightline as part of a year-long investigation of U.S. Customs and Border Protection conducted by ABC News and The Investigative Fund, shows that Velazquez took four drinks from the bottle, and the officers appear to repeatedly encourage him with hand gestures.

The Velazquez family ultimately filed a civil lawsuit against the officers and the agency, claiming that the officers' actions led to Cruz's death.

"What you see, I think, is a basic lack of compassion and decency toward a 16-year-old boy," said Gene Iredale, the San Diego-based attorney who represented the Velazquez family. "Almost a delight that you would see in children who just pull the wings off flies slowly, a smile when he's being asked to drink something and being put in this position."

Both officers, who declined through their attorneys to be interviewed by ABC News, denied asking Velazquez to drink from the bottle, and the official report called the incident an "accident." Officer Perallon claimed Velazquez "volunteered" to take a drink.

In response to the broader ABC News investigation, which revealed a history of cases in which the agency appeared to ignore accusations of mistreatment and abuse, the agency issued a statement, saying, "CBP takes all allegations of mistreatment seriously, and does not tolerate actions that are not consistent with our core values of vigilance, service to country and integrity."

The Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego released a brief statement to ABC News.

"The Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego provided consular and legal assistance to Mr. Cruz Velazquez's family since it learned about his death. This tragic incident highlights the need of greater transparency and accountability in immigration control activities."

Earlier this year, the U.S. government paid the teen's family $1 million to settle a lawsuit. There was no apology or admission of wrongdoing, and both officers testified that they never received a reprimand for their conduct, a fact that still angers members of Velazquez's family.

"How can the government allow that? It's like, OK you can kill someone," Reyna Velazquez, Cruz's sister, told ABC News. "They took him as a fool, as who cares. Well, that fool, he was the greatest person I ever knew."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A corrections officer was placed on administrative leave after pulling a gun on an ATV rider in North Pole while he was off duty.

According to the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, GoPro video footage taken May 29 by an all-terrain vehicle rider named Devarge Walker shows him riding down a gravel road when Gregory Braeuer, an off-duty corrections officer at the Fairbanks Correctional Center, gets out of his pickup, approaches Walker and says, "This ain't a racetrack."

Braeuer reaches for the ATV, and a struggle ensues. Walker tells Braeuer to "get the f–k off my bike. The f–k's wrong with you?" Braeuer responds, "What's wrong with you?"

Then Braeuer goes back to his truck, takes out a gun and walks toward Walker.

"Get on the ground right now," Braeuer says. After that point the GoPro camera moves and is facing part of the ATV. Braeuer references his badge and repeats himself: "Get on the f–king ground." Walker gets on the ground.

An argument ensues, and Walker tells Braeuer he is being recorded. Walker's friends are also heard talking.

Braeuer "is currently on administrative leave pending further administrative hearings," Alaska Department of Corrections spokesperson Megan Edge said in an email.

She said Alaska State Troopers are investigating the incident, as well as the DOC professional conduct unit.

"Correctional officers do not have the authority to detain anyone outside of a correctional facility," Edge said in the email. "Correctional officers are also not authorized to carry firearms in the course of their duties. As a private citizen, Mr. Braeuer does have the right to carry a firearm."

The News-Miner reported that Walker was charged with fourth-degree assault on July 5, and Braeuer "has not been charged."

Charlie Gard, the baby whose fate was the subject of a protracted court battle and made headlines around the world, has died, his parents have said.

They fought a five-month campaign to have him transferred from Great Ormond Street hospital, where he was on life support for experimental treatment they hoped could give Charlie, who was blind and deaf and could not breath without a ventilator, “a meaningful life”. But they abandoned their legal battle on Monday, saying it was too late to save him. On Thursday he was transferred to an unspecified hospice and he died the next day, a week before he would have turned one, after having his life support systems withdrawn.

In a statement, Charlie’s mother, Connie Yates, said: “Our beautiful little boy has gone. We are so proud of you, Charlie.”

Prime Minister Theresa May said she was “deeply saddened” by his death and her “thoughts and prayers” were with his parents.

After his parents accepted he had no realistic prospect of improvement, blaming the deterioration in his muscles while they were battling Gosh, whose doctors believed the experimental treatment would not work and only prolong Charlie’s suffering the couple fought further battles against Gosh in increasingly acrimonious proceedings.

But in the face of opposition from Gosh, which said the invasive ventilation required by Charlie was not deliverable at home, they agreed with the hospital that he would be transferred to a hospice for his final hours.

But still the parties disagreed with the family wanting to keep him alive for several days but the hospital saying that would require a 24/7 intensive care team which was impossible to find for a hospice setting.

The judge, Mr Justice gave the parents time to find such a team but they were unsuccessful and he directed that an alternative plan should be put in place involving a much shorter time spent at the hospice on life support, the details of which were were not made public.

Hundreds of people, who called themselves Charlie’s Army, supported the campaign for him to receive treatment in the US, raising £1.35m.

A spokeswoman for Gosh said on Thursday: “The risk of an unplanned and chaotic end to Charlie’s life is an unthinkable outcome for all concerned and would rob his parents of precious last moments with him.

“As the judge has now ruled, we will arrange for Charlie to be transferred to a specialist children’s hospice, whose remarkable and compassionate staff will support his family at this impossible time.”

Charlie had a form of mitochondrial disease, a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage, although his parents claimed the hospital was wrong in saying he had already suffered severe irreversible brain damage. Yates and Gard also disputed with Gosh that their son was in pain.

Earlier this month, Pope Francis said he had been following the case closely and hoped that Charlie’s parents would be able to “accompany and treat their child until the end”. The Vatican children’s hospital also offered to take over his care from Gosh.

Shortly afterwards, Trump tweeted: “If we can help little Charlie Gard, as per our friends in the UK and the pope, we would be delighted to do so.”

Gard and Yates, both in their 30s from Bedfont, west London, went back to the high court this month after claiming they had new evidence of the prospects of the NBT therapy being successful. But at an emotional court hearing on Monday, which saw both parents in tears, as well as lawyers, members of the public and press said they were finally abandoning the case, paying tribute to Charlie as

“absolute warrior”.

In a statement, Yates read out from the witness box in the packed courtroom in central London, Yates said: “Mummy and Daddy love you so much, Charlie, we always have and we always will, and we are so sorry that we couldn’t save you. We had the chance, but we weren’t allowed to give you that chance. Sweet dreams baby. Sleep tight, our beautiful little boy.”

Yates said time had been wasted and “had Charlie been given the treatment sooner, he would have had the potential to be a normal, healthy little boy”.

But doctors at Gosh did not agree, with lawyers representing the hospital saying the “clinical picture” six months ago had shown irreversible damage to Charlie’s brain.

Over the course of the legal dispute, a worldwide campaign mobilised in support of Charlie’s parents, raising £1.3m. But some supporters made death threats, condemned by Francis and Gard and Yates, against Gosh doctors and staff. A hospital spokeswoman said on Friday: “Everyone at Great Ormond Street Hospital sends their heartfelt condolences to Charlie’s parents and loved-ones at this very sad time.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Police body cam footage of man tased in back prompts $110K settlement

However, police board said tasing was “reasonable, appropriate, and within policy.”

Body cam footage of an Aurora, Colorado, cop tasing an unarmed black man in the back paved the way for the city to pay $110,000 to settle police abuse allegations, the man's lawyers told Ars Thursday.

Footage from September's tasing shows two black men being questioned by police who are responding to a weapons incident at a nearby apartment building. One of the men is seen and overheard on the video demanding to know why he's being questioned. "For what... ?" he says.

The victim, Darsean Kelley, then appears to thump his chest with his right hand and yell, "I know my rights." He's then tased in the back, loses his faculties, and falls flat on his back. He begins screaming uncontrollably, according to the video. Adding insult to injury, he's also arrested, charged with failure to obey police, and then jailed for three days because he's unable to post bail.

Body cams and dash cams are increasingly being deployed by police in the aftermath of high-profile shootings in recent years. They're designed to record police actions to protect cops from false allegations, and they're also used for public accountability purposes. In this instance, the video prompted a legal settlement. At the same time, however, police said the video showed the officer was not out of line.

"The body camera footage was indispensable in securing justice for Darsean Kelley," John M. Krieger, a spokesman with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, told Ars. "Without irrefutable evidence of police misconduct captured on video, it would have been our client's word against multiple officers, and the truth about what happened to Darsean would almost certainly have never come to light."

The ACLU eventually convinced the authorities to drop the charges against Kelley. Its lawyers argued that their client was illegally detained when he was outside with his cousin. All the while, the Aurora Police Department has ruled the tasing as acceptable within department policy. The city said it was settling the legal claim (PDF) before a lawsuit was filed to avoid the expense of litigation.

Aurora City Attorney Mike Hyman said in a statement that the city settled so it wouldn’t have to spend even more taxpayer money defending a lawsuit.

"We disagree with the ACLU's characterization of the events in this case and their unwarranted attack against the Aurora Police Department," Hyman said Thursday. "This case was settled for the reason that many cases are settled—to avoid the cost of prolonged litigation. That cost would have far exceeded the value of the settlement."

The police department's internal review board cleared the cops of wrongdoing in October, concluding that the use of force "was reasonable, appropriate, and within policy." The officer who deployed the electronic device believed Kelley was reaching for a weapon.

When officers arrived in the area of the call they found an agitated Kelley yelling at another man and lawfully stopped him. After failing to obey numerous orders, Mr. Kelley was tased and subsequently arrested and charged in Aurora Municipal Court with ACC 94-110(5) Failure to Obey Lawful Orders.

The use of force applied against Mr. Kelley was later reviewed by the Force Review Board (FRB). The FRB is empaneled to review uses of force to determine compliance with Department Directives, procedures, and training. The FRB determined the force applied in this incident was within policy.

The ACLU said Kelley was not hospitalized. But in its claim for damages, the ACLU said that, because of the incident, Kelley has "developed a deep and lasting fear of the police."

WASHINGOTN: Two Sikh Americans have been killed in two separate incidents in one week in California, according to community organisations and media reports.

Subag Singh, 68, was found dead in a canal after he went missing in the morning of June 23. His body had injuries.

California law enforcement officials from Fresno county have said that they were trying to find out who was responsible for the killing of the elderly Sikh American.

"Deputies found his body with visible trauma in a canal on McCall and Jensen. Investigators are trying to piece together what led up to the body being found in a canal," Fox26 news said in a report.

Deputies are not saying if this was a hate crime or not, but members of the Sikh community say this would not be the first, it said.

"Honestly, we are very hurt, it just hurts us. And it just we then, think what else do we need to do," Gurdeep Shergill, a local community leader, was quoted as saying.

In a separate incident, Simranjit Singh, 20, of Elk Grove was shot dead on July 25 outside a gas station where he worked.

According to Sacramento Bee news, he was shot dead by men who had earlier assaulted his co-worker.

"At this point in both investigations, it is unclear if either of these crimes were racially motivated but we are working with both local and federal laws enforcement authorities to ensure these murders are thoroughly investigated and that the local jurisdictions are treating the cases with the utmost importance," said Sikh American Legal Defence and Education Fund (SALDEF).

"These attacks are inexcusable and we offer our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of Subag Singh and Simranjit Singh.

"We call upon local and federal law enforcement agencies to thoroughly investigate these heinous crimes and classify them as hate incidents if hate is show to be a motive," SALDEF executive director Baldev Singh said.

There have been a number of attacks targeting Indian- Americans and Sikhs in the recent months in the US.

In March, a 39-year-old Sikh man was shot in the arm outside his home in Kent, Washington, by a partially-masked gunman who shouted "go back to your own country".

In February, 32-year-old Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed when a US Navy veteran opened fire at him and his friend Alok Madasani, yelling "get out of my country"

‘It is just a beginning,’ Imran Khan, Pakistan's opposition leader and a petitioner in the high-profile Panama case, said as he hailed the Supreme Court's decision to disqualify Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Pakistan's Supreme Court disqualified 67-year-old Sharif for dishonesty and ruled that corruption cases be filed against him and his children over the Panama Papers scandal, forcing the embattled leader out of office.

NEW YORK (AP) — Wealthy investors say former biotech CEO Martin Shkreli told them he was managing tens of millions of dollars' worth of investments, that they were making double-digit returns and they could withdraw their money at any time.

Prosecutors in closing arguments Thursday at Shkreli's securities fraud trial said it was all a brazen con. The defense countered that no one should feel sorry for the alleged victims because they were high-rollers who ended up doubling or tripling their money.

Shkreli, 34, is best known for jacking up the price of a life-saving drug and trolling his critics on social media, but his trial in Brooklyn has focused on his time running a pair of hedge funds.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith told jurors Shkreli "lied to investors to get their money into the funds and then lied to them so they wouldn't take it out."

The prosecutor recounted testimony by investors who told jurors that Shkreli claimed to be managing up to $40 million in one of his firms at a time when its brokerage account held only a few hundred dollars. When one investor asked for his money back, Shkreli stalled for months until he used a Ponzi-like scheme to secretly raid a second fund to return a portion of the funds, she said.

"The defendant was lying not only about the ability to get a redemption, but also about where that money was coming from," she said.

As Shkreli was "blowing up" his hedge funds with bad stock picks, he continued to recruit new investors by portraying himself as a Wall Street whiz who graduated from Columbia University, Smith said. He really attended a lesser-known public university, Baruch College.

Claims "that he was some sort of genius in the investing industry were completely untrue," she said.

The defense has sought to portray the impish Shkreli as a misunderstood eccentric who slept on the floor of his office in a sleeping bag for two years while starting a successful drug company that allowed him to enrich his alleged victims.

"Who does that if you're committing a fraud and you have millions of dollars in people's money?" said his attorney, Ben Brafman. "He has no life. He's the hermit scientist."

Shkreli is "not a Ponzi guy who's taking money and buying a Cadillac or a yacht," the lawyer added at another point.

The lawyer agreed Shkreli could be annoying, saying, "In terms of people skills, he's impossible." But he claimed the clients who appeared as government witnesses were still eager to bet on him.

Investors "found him strange. They found him weird. And they gave him money. Why? Because they recognized genius," Brafman said.

Shkreli didn't testify, but throughout the trial he has used Facebook to bash prosecutors and news organizations covering his case, despite his lawyer's efforts to shut him up. In one recent post, he wrote, "This was a bogus case from day one."

The trial is in its fifth week. Jury deliberations could begin on Friday.

NEW YORK (AP) — Former pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli was portrayed both as a swindler by the government and as a well-meaning prodigy by his lawyers on the second day of closing arguments Friday at his securities fraud trial.

The trial in federal court in Brooklyn "has exposed Martin Shkreli for who he really is — a con man who stole millions," Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis told jurors.

Prosecutors allege that the 34-year-old Shkreli looted his drug company, Retrophin, of stock and cash so he could pay back disgruntled investors in a pair of failed hedge funds he ran. Investors testified that the defendant repeatedly lied to them about what was going on with their money.

The defense has argued that no one was victimized because Shkreli used his "genius" to make Retrophin a success and ensure investors doubled or even tripled their money.

"Who lost anything? Nobody," defense attorney Ben Brafman said in his closing argument. Some investors were forced to admit on the witness stand that partnering with Shkreli was "the greatest investment I've ever made," he added.

The lawyer also argued that a drug company official who testified for the government was biased. If Shkreli is found guilty of a felony, Brafman said, the company would have clear grounds for forcing him out as CEO in 2014 and would gain ammunition in its $65 million lawsuit against him. Shkreli claims he was wrongfully terminated and is owed millions.

With a guilty verdict, "Retrophin pops a Champagne cork," he said.

Shkreli became notorious for using another drug company to raise the price of a life-saving drug 5,000 percent and for trolling his critics on social media, where he's been dubbed "Pharma Bro."

The defendant didn't testify. But he made his thoughts on the case known on Facebook, where he called it "bogus."

The jury was expected to begin deliberating as soon as Friday afternoon.

'People fear what they don't understand': Culture clash with immigrants divides Pa. town

CALIFORNIA, Pa. -- Almost overnight they arrived, close to 100 Romanian immigrants who are members of a minority group called Roma, to take up residence in this small town along the Monongahela River.

If you've heard of California, it's probably because of the university. That's at one end of town, with brick buildings and bright colors. The rest of the town is filled with homes and businesses that are more time-worn, many of them built to house steelworkers and coal miners before those industries evaporated. Now they are home to their children, and grandchildren.

With a population of just about 6,700, it's a place where everyone knows everyone. But the presence of the newcomers, who arrived in May, seems to be tearing apart the bonds that have been built over generations.

"This is turning lifelong friends against each other," said Rebecca Daniels, who has lived in California her entire life. "I don't know if this can be fixed."

Immigrants took up residence in vacant, off-campus student housing -- particularly one rustic-looking apartment building where this week small, dark-haired children ran and played. Men in crisp polo shirts or clean, white button downs sat around tables and talked and smoked. Women, in long dresses, some wearing traditional Muslim head dressings, did the same, huddled on a long, splintered porch, apart from the men.

Some in California, many descended from immigrants, say they want to welcome their new neighbors and help them become a part of the community.

But others say the Roma -- sometimes referred to as gypsies --are different than the Italian Americans who came to town a handful of generations ago. Neighbors say - and loudly proclaimed at a recent borough council meeting - that the Roma refuse to assimilate, or even communicate, and have been wreaking havoc since their unexpected arrival.

They tell stories of Roma butchering chickens and defecating in public. Those stories recently gained attention when they were repeated on national television by Tucker Carlson, host of Fox News show "Tucker Carlson Tonight."

It's difficult to tell how and when this group of Roma got to the United States, but officials with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement say there are 97 of them living in California.

They are here unlawfully, officials say, and are part of ICE's Alternative to Detention Program, which allows them to remain in the community as they await court hearings and final orders to stay or to be deported back to Romania.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services could not confirm that the Roma are seeking asylum since those applications are confidential, but one Roma who briefly spoke with PennLive said that is why they are here - seeking asylum from persecution in their home country, something these nomadic people have suffered across Europe for decades, even centuries.

She said her name is Dochia.

She appeared to be in her late 20s and drank Coca Cola out of a wine glass as she smoked a cigarette. She was surrounded by several older women and spoke on the condition that no photos would be taken. During the interview Wednesday evening, a half-dozen children ran around the yard, shouting and playing.

That's why she came to the United States, she said. For the children.

"In my country, no help for kids," Dochia said. "I want to make good life in America with kids."

When she mentioned her home country, an older woman sitting next to her chimed in.

"Romania criminal," she said.

California, on the other hand, is a much better place, Dochia said. It's kind and welcoming, she said. And safe.

"This city is good," Dochia said. "Good people in California."

And many in California want to help. But they are having trouble getting through not only a language barrier, but also the cultural barrier of a people who tend to keep to themselves.

It has been tough getting to know the Roma, say the locals, even those who say they still want to help.

"This is what we know is right in our hearts," said lifelong resident Rosemary Capanna.

A helping hand

When Capanna's grandparents came here from Italy, they were not welcomed at first. Many immigrants - Italian, eastern European - lived on the outskirts of town and were considered to be outsiders, she said.

But as the generations grew up together, they gradually accepted one another, becoming neighbors and friends. And Capanna's grandparents would likely be proud to know that she is now the town's Democratic candidate for mayor.

"They weren't refugees, but they faced something similar," Capanna said of her grandparents. "Assimilation does not happen overnight."

This week, she and attorney Lisa Buday, who spoke at a recent borough council meeting to ask her neighbors to be supportive of the Roma, agreed to talk about what has been going on in their town.

"I don't agree with lawlessness; however, we don't know who they are," Buday said about the Roma. The people of California need to start building relationships with the Roma, and learn more about them in order to create that bond of community, she said. That's what will help the community overcome the problems it's facing.

Buday thinks that many of those problems referred to by Tucker Carlson have been exaggerated.

An incident in which a chicken was killed happened early on and can be attributed to cultural differences, she said. And the public defecation? She said she understands that was a one-time thing, adding that it was simply a case involving a little boy who couldn't make it home in time.

She has had no problems with the Roma. Buday says "hello" when she sees them on the street, and she allows the children to come into her law firm's lobby to play with Oliver, the office cat.

"They're a community of people and we're trying to figure out how best to get to know them," Buday said.

She and Capanna are not sure why there has been such a public outcry against the Roma. They speculate that it's because the Roma are so visible, spending most evenings sitting on their porches.

"Maybe we should all sit on our porches and hang out," Buday said. "What they do is not all that removed from what our immigrant families did 50 years ago."

"From my perspective, people fear what they don't understand," Capanna said. "I don't know if it's fear or a lack of understanding."

Capanna loves her town and knows its residents can come around to accept their new neighbors.

It's also a town the Roma say they love. Dochia said she hopes she is granted asylum so her family can stay here, where she says the people have been kind.

"No problem with the American people," she said, motioning toward the yard where her children played. "Everything OK. See? Kids playing."

The problem, others in town say, is that the Roma have not returned the favor.

'Pure havoc'

Pam Duricic is another lifelong California resident, and earlier this month, she was a vocal part of the group that showed up at a borough council meeting. They had questions, and they wanted to report the problems they have seen.

Her neighbor, Teresa Dearinger, agreed, saying one day in May, the college students left for the summer, and all of a sudden, the Roma showed up.

"It was a shock to our community," Dearinger said.

The women say California is a quaint, family-oriented place. Dearinger moved here to raise her three children in this environment.

"We have always been a welcoming, open community," Duricic said. "We have a small university, a lot of diversity. The crime rate is next to nothing, normally. We never had any problems. Until now."

Since she spoke out at the borough council meeting, Duricic said she and her neighbors have been unfairly portrayed as closed minded and racist. That is not the case, she said, and the race of the Roma is not the issue at all.

"It's people who are not following our laws and rules," Dearinger said.

She and Duricic talked of cars speeding through the streets, traffic accidents, shoplifting attempts at Dollar General, trash strewn about yards. Some incidents they say they witnessed themselves; some they heard about from neighbors and friends.

Based on that, they believe the problems are greater than an isolated incident or two of a chicken being beheaded.

Rebecca Daniels' son took a video of some Roma slaughtering a chicken and a turkey in the Roma's yard.

And the defecation? That was more than just one child, Duricic added.

"These were not children. They were grown men, dropping their pants," she said.

Daniels said her son's car was also damaged by a Roma neighbor who sped backwards into it. The insurance company told her the car was rental from Florida - one that had been missing for solong the rental company stopped paying the insurance on it, she said.

There were numerous thefts, they say, including Dearinger's children's toys being stolen from her porch.

As the group was advised to do at the council meeting, they have been calling the police and documenting what they see, including an incident Tuesday night.

Duricic and Dearinger said a group of Roma men in an apartment building near their homes had been drinking all day. They got loud and boisterous and the children threw empty beer bottles into the street to watch them roll downhill.

When an argument broke out, one of the men struck one of the women, they say. Dearinger said she has since been subpoenaed by police to testify about this.

Police Chief Richard Encapera is the only officer authorized to speak to the media, and he was on vacation this week. Borough administrator Richard Martin would not talk to PennLive. Borough council president Patsy Alfano and Mayor Walter Weld Jr. did not return phone calls for comment.

That's part of the problem, from Duricic's perspective. She said she is getting few answers from her town officials, many of whom are lifelong friends. Even after the meeting, she walked away with just as many unanswered questions. How long will the Roma be here? Will the children go to school in California? Will they face the same penalties for breaking the law as the residents? Is ICE monitoring them?

She and some friends have tried to reach out to the Roma, saying hello, trying to start conversations. But the Roma don't respond and don't seem to want that, she said.

And in the meantime, among the locals, lifelong friendships have crumbled. She said there are people she has known her entire life who no longer speak to her. She receives nasty comments on Facebook.

"We all grew up in school together, attended town functions together, but now you are seeing that divide," she said. "Our small town that we all loved for years and chose to stay here and raise our children is no longer. It all went up in smoke."

A few blocks away, sitting on her porch with the other Roma women, Dochia said she was unaware of such problems in this town that has treated her so well.

When asked about the butchering of chickens, she explained the Roma are Muslim and chicken is a significant part of their diet since they do not eat pork. It was an isolated incident, she said.

That's where PennLive's conversation with Dochia was cut short by a dark-haired man with a heavy five o'clock shadow and a blue polo shirt.

"Our religion, no talk to women," the man said, walking up to the porch, cigarette in hand.

When asked if there was someone else who could talk, he said, walking away, "Come tomorrow. Guy come for you."

He and several other men said the same thing the day before. "Come tomorrow."

An attempt to speak to another group of Roma at a home next to California's only gas station ended similarly.

Using the Google Translate app, this PennLive reporter tried to speak to several men sitting around a table, smoking cigarettes and drinking Mountain Dew. At the sight of the phone, a balding, older man dressed in white held up his hand and said "No pictures."

When he saw the translation and realized it was a request for an interview, he simply said, "Come tomorrow."

Some California residents say the self-imposed isolation of the Romas is the root of the problems. Others say it's simply a hurdle to overcome.

But mayoral candidate Rosemary Capanna said since folks in town heard about her efforts to reach out to this community, she has been getting private messages from some of the older residents.

"They remember this happening to them," Capanna said. She hopes an understanding can be reached soon for the sake of the town they all love. "In the end, we all live together here."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Richland County Sheriff's Department says three teens have been arrested in a crime spree that was escalating from a delivery robbery to armed robberies to a near sexual assault. And the victims were targeted because of their race, according to Sheriff Leon Lott.

"This was a crime spree. They would not have stopped," Lott said. "They made a statement that they did not like white people and they were only going to rob white people."

Lott says the two suspects, 17-year-old Raquan Green and a 15-year-old whose name has not been released, were arrested Wednesday. The third suspect, a 15-year-old boy, was taken into custody at his home on Walcott Street. Lott says the trio used racism to pick their victims.

The third suspect resisted arrest and injured an RSCD investigator in the process. The investigator had to be hospitalized with a leg injury and is expected to be OK. The suspect is now being charged with assault on a police officer while resisting arrest. Sheriff Lott says that should the investigator require surgery or an extensive hospital stay, charges may be upgraded.

"Between July 3 and July 26 there have been seven separate incidents of armed robberies, some to include carjacking and kidnapping along the Bluff /Shop Road Corridor," Lott said. "Investigators discovered that the suspects began targeting delivery drivers by committing armed robberies. The crimes then escalated to carjacking and kidnapping victims."

The crime spree started on July 3 when a food delivery driver was robbed. Two more incidents of food delivery robberies happened on July 15 and July 17. On July 19, a food delivery driver was robbed and forced to drive to an ATM and withdraw money.

All the incidents happened late at night where delivery drivers were targeted and students were moving into student housing or leaving apartments in the area. The suspects stole cash, cell phones, and various electronics.

07/25 -2:00 a.m. the victim was robbed, carjacked and kidnapped at Stadium Suites (Involved third suspect)

7/26 -1:15 a.m. the victim was robbed and kidnapped at 1050 Southern Drive, (Village at Columbia Apartments) (Involved the third suspect)

Lott says one of the victims, who was African American, was released from the suspects when they found out she was not white.

Green appeared in court and was given $40,000 bond. He is still housed at the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center as of Thursday evening.

Jordan, the only victim who spoke at the press conference, said she was returning home to her apartment at The Village Apartments on Southern Drive from work on July 26 around 12:15 a.m. when a group of three black males pushed her to the ground and placed a gun to her head.

The report says the men threatened to kill her unless she drove them to a nearby ATM. She complied, the report said, and withdrew $300 from her account.

It was at that point, according to the incident report, one of the men told the victim she was going to be used for sex at his "auntie's" house, but the victim found a way to escape by jumping out of her moving vehicle on Blair Road.

Deputies responded to the scene and located the victim's empty car. The K9 unit was brought out to search for the suspects, but they were not found.

Another similar incident happened at Stadium Suites where a 20-year-old victim said he and his roommate were returning home one night this past weekend when they were approached by three males with guns. The two were then driven to an ATM at gunpoint and asked to provide $500. The victim says the suspects were only able to obtain $600 before abandoning the two in a nearby parking lot.

A different student who lives at Oaks 21 Apartments, said she believes she came close to something similar when a stranger attempted to open her car door while she was sitting inside.

A statement released via a spokesperson from Stadium Suites' parent company, JMG Realty, says are extremely concerned about these recent crimes.

"We are cooperating fully with authorities, and have informed our residents via email and through our resident portal, of the recent crimes that have been reported to us," the statement said. "We will continue to keep our residents informed as we learn of developments or warnings from the local authorities. The safety and welfare of our residents are our top priority."

The University of South Carolina has released a statement, saying:

We are grateful to the Richland County Sheriff’s Department for their efforts to investigate these off-campus incidents and bring those responsible to justice. We have a strong partnership with RCSD and are appreciative of their longstanding support of USC and our students.

FOUNTAIN — Water providers and residents south of Colorado Springs chafed as the U.S. Air Force on Tuesday unveiled a nine-month study verifying that firefighting foam used at Peterson Air Force Base contaminated water and soil with toxic perfluorinated chemicals at levels more than 1,000 times higher than a national health advisory limit.

Air Force officials pledged to conduct further investigations that, sometime after 2019, may include analysis of human health risks. This initial investigation focused on contamination at the base. The spread of contaminants to where tens of thousands of people live remains a mystery, the officials said.

Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment leaders have said the state was waiting on the Air Force for information on how far and how fast PFCs have moved. El Paso County and CDPHE officials at a public meeting here Tuesday night said their agencies lack money to track the PFCs moving in groundwater at unknown concentrations south toward Pueblo.

“It makes me really angry that it has taken them this long to get some numbers — and more than a little concerned,” said Fountain City Council member Greg Lauer, who has been fielding calls from anxious residents for a year. “We and our ratepayers are going to be dealing for a very long time with this problem we did not create.”

Security Water and Sanitation District manager Roy Heald said his agency spent $3.6 million on pipelines and purchases of alternative clean water supplies after municipal wells were contaminated but has yet to receive a promised $800,000 in reimbursements from the Air Force.

“Our need is immediate. It is financial. And we need to get back to being able to use our well water,” Heald said.

“PFCs are found widely in the environment today, and there are likely other contributors to the contamination,” the report summary says. “As we continue our work with the public water suppliers in the Fountain, Widefield and Security area, we will study remediation steps, as other potential contributors are investigated.”

Air Force engineers in October began investigating to determine sources of the PFCs that state and local water tests had shown to be spreading from the base, including an area where firefighters trained. PFCs have been linked to health harm — low birth weights and kidney and testicular cancers — but public health epidemiological work in Colorado has not been done. A senior Pentagon official announced that the Air Force would spend $2 billion on PFC cleanups nationwide.

The EPA in May 2016 set a health advisory limit for two types of PFCs at 70 ppt based on the latest scientific studies of what could be harmful to people and the planet.

Air Force engineers investigating at Peterson found that PFCs from firefighting foam also had contaminated irrigation ponds at a golf course at high levels. “A complete human exposure pathway exists for golfers and golf course maintenance personnel exposed to surface water,” the report says.

The U.S. government does not regulate PFCs, which also are used to make products such as stain-proof carpet, nonstick cookware and grease-resistant fast-food wrappers.

Air Force Civil Engineering Center team leader Cornell Long said military funding for environment work on this problem is secure for now. An expanded site investigation to be completed next year may include data about concentrations of PFCs beyond the base. Long also said the Air Force will honor its commitments to reimburse communities south of Colorado Springs with a total of $4.3 million.

“This is an Air Force-wide issue. As good stewards of the environment, and wanting to do the right thing for communities, it is important that we continue to work at this,” he said. “There is still more work to be done.”

The contamination levels documents in Colorado “are very similar” to levels found at other air bases around the nation and abroad, he said. “What makes it difficult here is the wide range of contamination we are seeing on the base — and the information we do not have on how the contamination might move.”

A CDPHE website shows the contaminants have spread south beyond Widefield, Security and Fountain through the Fountain Creek watershed. In April 2016, groundwater samples taken south of Fountain along Hanover Road showed PFC contamination higher than 100 ppt.

State tests for PFCs in drinking water have not been done since November, CDPHE records show. And the CDPHE hasn’t measured PFCs in groundwater since February, the records show.

On Tuesday, Tyson Ingels, CDPHE’s lead drinking-water engineer, said agency officials “are not doing any tests now. We don’t have the funds to pay for any testing.”

El Paso County health spokeswoman Danielle Oller said the county also lacks funding to track PFC contamination, but that private well owners wanting tests will be referred to the Air Force for possible help.

“They need to be testing the water,” local farmer Susan Gordon said, adding that a filter provided by the Air Force may be losing its effectiveness.

Gordon and scores of other residents of Fountain, Security and Widefield have turned to buying bottled water.

“It is a major frustration,” said Deborah Stout-Meininger, 63, a resident of Fountain for 20 years, who supplements her Social Security income with work at a truck stop but finds the $40 a month extra she pays for water a burden.

“And I get really paranoid now,” she said. “I worry about whether the I am drinking safe water or not.”

Dentures left at scene lead to Tennessee man's rape conviction 16 years later

A 67-year-old man who previously served prison time in the murder of a 6-year-old child, pleaded guilty to a 2001 rape after investigators linked him to the scene of that crime through a pair of dentures he left behind.

The dentures were part of a sex assault kit backlog that wasn't tested until recently, though authorities may have been able to identify Thomas Maupin sooner -- his name was printed on the inside of the false teeth.

Maupin was sentenced to eight years in prison for raping the 31-year-old woman in Memphis in August 2001, FOX 13 Memphis reported.

At the time, police said the victim was approached by a motorist who got out of his car and started walking to her. A pair of dentures recovered at the scene were collected and tagged by investigators as part of the sexual assault kit.

The kit was later placed in the police property room, but became part of a backlog that was not tested until July 2016, WREG reported.

Officials from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation were able to eventually match the dentures to a partial DNA profile of Maupin -- and also discovered his name printed inside.

The dentures were originally made while Maupin served time in Washington state for the 1988 murder of a 6-year-old girl. He was twice convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison, but the convictions were overturned on appeal.

The US embassy has been told to cut its staffing levels

Russia has retaliated to new US sanctions by telling Washington to cut its diplomatic staff to 455 and barring the use of some properties.

The new US embassy staffing level would be the same as at Russia's embassy in Washington.

The Russian foreign ministry also said it was seizing holiday properties and a warehouse used by US diplomats.

The new US sanctions are over Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and alleged interference in the US election.

They come months after the Obama administration ordered the seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in response to alleged hacking of the US Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign.

In a statement on Friday, Russia's foreign ministry said: "The US is stubbornly taking one crudely anti-Russian step after another, using the utterly fictitious pretext of Russian interference in its internal affairs."

The US expulsion of Russian diplomats "clearly violates the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations and generally accepted diplomatic norms", it added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A TEXAS teen who ran into a church half-naked saying she was raped was indicted for what turned out to be an elaborate hoax.

Breana Harmon, 19, was charged on Wednesday with two counts of tampering with physical evidence and two counts of tampering with a government record, which are felonies, according to the Herald Democrat.

Officials said that teen, who also uses the last name Talbott, made a false report to police on March 8 claiming to have been abducted and gang-raped behind a church in Denison, Texas.

The teen turned up at the local church covered in blood and wearing only a shirt, bra and underwear. She allegedly told parishioners that black men had taken her into the woods and raped her.

Harmon, then 18, told police that she was raped by two black men in ski masks while a third pinned her down. She claimed that the suspects had kidnapped her near her car in an apartment parking lot, news station KXII reported.

Police discovered her car with a door open and her phone, keys and shoe scattered on the ground.

Harmon was brought to a nearby hospital for examination, where physicians determined she had not suffered any injuries consistent with her claims, according to police.

Authorities searched for further evidence, but were not able to corroborate Harmon’s story. Police also said the crime scene was “staged” and Harmon’s injuries were “self-inflicted.”

When investigators confronted Harmon, she admitted that the allegations were false. It is not known what prompted her to report the hoax.

She was arrested in March for the misdemeanour offence of false report to a police officer, but officials decided to seek more charges.

“The more we have looked at what happened in this case, and considered the harm it caused, and certainly could have caused, we believe what she did fits the elements of these higher charges,” Grayson County District Attorney Joe Brown said in a statement.

“What she did was very serious, and we believe it was felony conduct.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Weather Forecast

Woman who threatened to 'kill all of ya' Somali Americans will be fired

FARGO — A white woman from Mapleton, N.D., who was recorded Tuesday, July 25, threatening a group of three Muslim women in the Walmart parking lot on 13th Avenue South, telling them to "go home" and that she would kill them, will lose her job.

“Whenever she gets here, she will be let go.” said a person at Fargo accounting firm Horab and Wentz, who would only identify himself as one of the firm's partners on Wednesday, July 26.

The man said of Amber Elizabeth Hensley: “Her views are not ours." A couple phones could be heard ringing in the background.

She was in the car with her sister, Leyla Hassan, 20, and their friend, 23-year-old Rowda Soyan. All three women live in Fargo and are originally from Somalia. They were shopping at Walmart Tuesday afternoon before going to the movie theater when they parked next to the woman.

Hensley, whose Twitter account expresses support for President Trump, commented on Facebook about the video, identifying herself and apologizing to the women.

"It was not a Christian like thing to do AT ALL and wish I could take it back, but I lost my cool and I can't. I am terribly sorry," Hensley wrote in her post. "I just wish that the whole video could be shown. And the things that were stated before she starts taping. She had parked way too close to my car and I couldn't get in, when I asked her to move she refused, I asked her again and she swore at me calling me a fat b-tch."

"But there are absolutely no excuses. I am in tears with regret and will take any form of punishment deemed fit."

Sarah Hassan said she started recording when she realized they needed evidence of the woman's "unacceptable" behavior. They called police around 5:30 p.m. and showed officers the video and the woman's license plate number as they filed a report.

Officers did not return phone calls Tuesday evening.

The women shared their concerns and the video with Hukun Dabar, executive director of Afro American Development Association, a Moorhead nonprofit. Dabar then shared the video on Facebook

Within two hours of posting the video Tuesday night, it was shared more than 530 times.

"What makes me sad is you don't see any leaders from Fargo confronting this issue and saying it's not acceptable in our community," he said. "They need to speak about this issue and have it be at the forefront."

Fargo-Moorhead is supposed to be a "welcoming city," Dabar said, but "when they don't talk about this issue it shows something else."

Dabar also called out the inaction of bystanders at Walmart who didn't defend the women or say anything to Hensley. He tied this incident to a recent case of discrimination in Moorhead.

A Somali-American man was assaulted while moving into an apartment on July 2 by two white men from the area who said, "What are these n---- doing here?" at the time of the attack, according to eyewitnesses.

Police arrested the men, James Patrick Billiot and Justin William Rifanburg, who were charged with simple assault, a misdemeanor. CAIR, a Muslim civil rights group in Minnesota, urged state and federal law enforcement officials to investigate what they called a "possible hate crime."

"It's happening again," Dabar said in reference to the two instances of discrimination in the community.

Police are urging anyone who saw the girls around the time of the attacks to come forward

A girl of 15 was raped at a train station in Birmingham before being sexually assaulted by the driver of a car she flagged down to help her.

Detectives called the two attacks at Witton station "horrifying" and said they were launching a major manhunt.

The teenager was with a friend when she was approached by a man who led her to a secluded part of the station and raped her.

Shortly after she flagged down a passing car and was assaulted again.

British Transport Police and West Midlands Police are treating it as two separate reports of rape.

The first attacker is described by police as an Asian man in his early 20s with light skin, brown eyes, skinny build and about 6ft tall.

Police said the second man was also Asian and in his early 20s and about 5ft 6in to 5ft 7in tall. He was of a large build, with a beard and wore a blue jumper and black jeans.

The attacks happened between 19:00 BST on Tuesday and 02:00 on Wednesday.

CCTV has been seized and is being investigated.

'Awful incidents'

Det Ch Insp Tony Fitzpatrick said: "This was a horrifying ordeal for this young girl and we have specially trained officers supporting her.

"It is now vitally important we investigate exactly what happened on Wednesday morning as well as identifying offenders for both of these awful incidents.

"I would be keen to speak with anyone who may have been in the area at the time. If you were passing by the station and saw two girls walking with an older man, then please get in touch immediately.

"Likewise, if you saw any suspicious vehicles close to Witton station close to 2am then please get in touch as soon as possible. Your information could prove vital in our enquiries to identify the perpetrators."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Jarvis' wife, Petra, was a new patient of Graham and had an appointment on Wednesday, officials said. The doctor at the appointment informed Jarvis and his wife that, even though she suffered from pain, he would not prescribe the opioid.

"He did what we ask our doctors to do," St. Joseph County Prosecutor Ken Cotter said at a news conference. "Don't over-prescribe opioids."

Dr. Todd Graham

Graham had declined to prescribe Petra Jarvis the medication during a 10:45 a.m. appointment Wednesday. At around 1 p.m., Michael Jarvis returned to the medical complex off of Elm Road near Mishawaka, without his wife or her knowledge, and ambushed Graham, a physician with South Bend Orthopedics, police said.

After a brief argument in the parking lot, Michael Jarvis told two witnesses to leave the scene before shooting Graham twice in the head.

Jarvis then drove away in a red Dodge Neon to a friend's home at the corner of Dragoon Trail and Valley Trail, about three miles away, and "gave them indication that he was not going to be around," Cotter said.

The friend called police, who shortly later found Jarvis dead outside the home from two self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

Cotter said Michael Jarvis was not a patient of Graham's.

"Make no mistake, this is a person who made a choice to kill Dr. Graham," Cotter said. "This is not a fallout from the opioid epidemic or any opioid problems. That probably leads us into an examination of what is happening with the opioid problem in our community, and frankly, our whole nation."

Metro Homicide Commander Tim Corbett said people inside the buildings at the medical complex were fortunate.

"If Jarvis would have gotten inside that building, although there would have been a specific target, it's like trapping an animal in a corner, they're going to come out fighting, and I truly believe this could have escalated into a mass shooting," Corbett said.

Cotter said he's received calls from doctors since the tragedy and he is trying to start a dialogue with the medical community about how to prevent such incidents in the future.

"This is a clear indication that it's not just a doctor issue, it's not just a law enforcement issue, it's our whole community's issue," Cotter said.

The red Neon was still parked in the driveway of Michael Jarvis' friend's home Thursday. A Notre Dame staff parking tag hung from the rearview mirror, and the backseat contained a cooler with "JARVIS" written on it.

LOS ANGELES -- USC football coach Clay Helton said former Heisman Trophy-winning running back O.J. Simpson would not be welcome on campus after he is released from prison in October.

"Right now with USC, what the administration and the athletic department have said is, no, O.J. will not be a part of our functions," Helton said when asked whether Simpson would be welcome to attend a practice. "That's been the statement."

Simpson was granted parole last week in Nevada after more than eight years in prison there since being convicted in 2008 of an armed robbery involving two sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel room. The 70-year-old Simpson could be out of prison as early as Oct. 1 after serving the minimum nine years of a 33-year sentence.

Despite the university distancing itself from Simpson after he was found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman in a highly publicized trial in 1995, Simpson's No. 32 jersey is still retired and prominently displayed at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during USC home games, and a copy of the Heisman Trophy that Simpson won in 1968 is still displayed on campus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Trump ban on transgender service members alarms some military officers

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's sudden decision to ban transgender personnel from serving in the military has alarmed some senior military officers who were caught off guard by it.

Trump's declaration, which came via early morning tweets on Wednesday, appeared to pre-empt an ongoing Pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military, and he drew criticism from three senior officers interviewed by Reuters on Thursday.

"I hope our commander in chief understands that we don't transmit orders via Twitter, and that he can't, either," one said by telephone, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

"Even if this were an order, implementing it legally would take considerable time, if it's even possible."

Rights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused Trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active-duty service members and reservists, who say they number in the thousands..

The United States' top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, told the armed forces on Thursday there had been no change yet to Pentagon policy on transgender personnel.

Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged the uncertainty that followed Trump's announcement in a note to service chiefs, commanders and senior enlisted leaders.

"I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement on the transgender policy by the President," Dunford wrote.

"There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance," Dunford said in the message, first reported by Reuters.

Dunford then made the assurance that the military would "treat all of our personnel with respect."

His message neither voiced support nor opposition to Trump's decision.

One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force acknowledged that Trump's announcement on Wednesday was "unexpected."

The Defense Department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year. But Mattis on June 30 approved a six-month delay to allow for a review.

As a presidential candidate, Trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.

His move on Wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow Republicans.

The White House said Trump had "extensive discussions with his national security team," and that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president decided on Tuesday to go ahead.

Trump cited "tremendous medical costs and disruption" as a justification for the ban, a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individual's capabilities, not gender identity or sexual preference.

The Army's chief of staff, General Mark Milley, said on Thursday that there had been issues with transgender individuals serving in the Army.

"I will be candid. ... This is a complex issue and there (are) a variety of challenges out there that we have to deal with and we have been working through it, but this is not clean-cut either way," he said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said implementation of Trump's decision was still being worked out.

Separately, the Trump administration on Thursday told a U.S. appeals court in New York that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position Democratic former President Barack Obama took.

Trump's plan to ban transgender military service members has unleashed legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue.

Trump's tweets did not make clear when a ban would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join.

But if the Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight, legal experts say.

"There's no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military," said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal.

It was also unclear whether it might go beyond active-duty forces and apply to reservists.

'Breaks Your Spirit'

Indiana National Guard reservist Cameron St. Andrew, who resigned from full-time service after the November election, told Reuters that as a transgender person he was concerned about his status.

"I try to be tough about it," he said, but added: "It breaks your spirit down."

One active-duty U.S. military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said senior officials were not consulted.

"We're scratching our heads and asking where the hell this came from," the officer said by phone.

"Maybe the president is in step with some members of Congress and some voters, but he is out of step with today’s military. Our service personnel today don’t give a damn about the personal lives of their comrades so long as they know they can trust them when it counts."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    NASA scientists will chase solar eclipse in jets

Scientists will follow the shadow of the moon in two retrofitted WB-57F jet planes

For armchair astronomers and nearly everyone else watching the skies during the total solar eclipse Aug. 21, it will all be over in 2½ minutes.

But a team of NASA-funded scientists chasing the moon's shadow in retrofitted WB-57F jet planes will experience the rare phenomenon for more than seven extraordinary minutes.

A team led by Amir Caspi of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., will follow the darkness of the eclipse across the United States in two of NASA's research jets. The planes will take off from Houston and cross over Missouri, Illinois and Tennessee.

Mounted on the noses of both planes will be telescopes aimed to capture the clearest images taken to date of the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona.

"These could well turn out to be the best ever observations of high frequency phenomena in the corona," Dan Seaton, co-investigator of the project and researcher at the University of Colorado in Boulder, said in a written statement.

"Extending the observing time and going to very high altitude might allow us to see a few events or track waves that would be essentially invisible in just two minutes of observations from the ground."

Rare opportunity

During a total solar eclipse, the moon completely blocks the sun, allowing the sun's corona to be seen in stark contrast to the surrounding darkness.

Scientists hope to untangle some of the mystery around why the outer layers of the sun's atmosphere are actually hotter than the layers closer to the sun.

Micro explosions on the sun's surface — known as nanoflares — could play a part in this puzzling phenomenon, and the eclipse offers a rare opportunity to observe them.

At the same time, the team expects to get thermal images of Mercury to find out how temperatures vary across the surface of the planet closest to the sun.

NASA is funding 11 projects that will allow scientists to use the eclipse to learn about the sun and its relationship to the Earth's upper atmosphere.

It is a command that led the leading atheist Richard Dawkins to claim that the God of the Old Testament was “a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser … a genocidal … megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully”.

For God had ordered the Israelites to slaughter the apparently sinful Canaanites, saying: “You shall not leave alive anything that breathes. But you shall utterly destroy them.” And, according to the Bible, they did just that.

However, a new genetic study has found that the Canaanites actually managed to survive this purge of their traditional homeland, passing on their DNA over the centuries to their numerous descendants in modern-day Lebanon.

“The Bible reports the destruction of the Canaanite cities and the annihilation of its people; if true, the Canaanites could not have directly contributed genetically to present-day populations,” the researchers wrote.

“However, no archaeological evidence has so far been found to support widespread destruction of Canaanite cities between the Bronze and Iron Ages: cities on the Levant coast such as Sidon and Tyre show continuity of occupation until the present day.

“We show that present-day Lebanese derive most of their ancestry from a Canaanite-related population, which therefore implies substantial genetic continuity in the Levant since at least the Bronze Age.”

The degree of genetic closeness between the ancient Canaanites and modern Lebanese people was something of a surprise as the area was repeatedly fought over and conquered by various different groups throughout history, although some of them did leave genetic traces that survive to this day.

One of the researchers, Dr Marc Haber, of The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said: "The present-day Lebanese are likely to be direct descendants of the Canaanites, but they have in addition a small proportion of Eurasian ancestry that may have arrived via conquests by distant populations such as the Assyrians, Persians, or Macedonians.”

He added that it had been a “pleasant surprise” to be able to extract and analyse DNA from human remains that were nearly 4,000 years old, particularly as they were found in a hot environment.

The Canaanites are roundly condemned in the Old Testament – they were the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, two cities destroyed with fire and brimstone directly by God, according to the Book of Genesis.

While the Bible says they were wiped out by the Israelites under Joshua in the land of Canaan, later passages suggest there were at least a few survivors. Some Biblical scholars have argued the passages are hyperbole, but the genetic research would appear to indicate the slaughter was much less extensive than described.

Also known as the Phoenicians, the Canaanites proved to be great seafaring traders and established colonies across the Mediterranean.

They are also credited with inventing the first alphabet, although ironically few written records have survived the passage of time, so accounts describing them largely come from enemies and rivals, such as the Israelites, Egyptians and Greeks.

The researchers said they hoped genetic techniques could help shed more light on the region’s history.

Dr Claude Doumet-Serhal, a co-author of the paper and director of the Sidon excavation site in Lebanon, said: “For the first time we have genetic evidence for substantial continuity in the region, from the Bronze Age Canaanite population through to the present day.

“These results agree with the continuity seen by archaeologists. Collaborations between archaeologists and geneticists greatly enrich both fields of study and can answer questions about ancestry in ways that experts in neither field can answer alone.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mom reveals she used breast milk in school bake sale brownies

A mother recently posted anonymously to a parenting group on Facebook to reveal she had used her breast milk in a batch of bake sale brownies at her children’s school, and that some moms weren’t thrilled about it.

“I didn’t have time to run to the store and didn’t think it was a big deal (some of those kids could use the nutrition let’s be honest). And it wasn’t even that much,” the mother wrote. “One of the other moms found out and are blowing it way out of proportion. Idk what to do! Any suggestions?”

The comments under the post ranged from anger, to admiration, to absolute hilarity.

Some accused her of putting their children’s health at risk, saying it was comparable to exposing them to any other bodily fluids, while others downplayed the incident with sarcastic quips.

Louis Tramunti’s Wife Thought He Was Having a Heart Attack. So Why Did the Police Break His Back?

He made it unscathed from Whitestone to Westchester. Then his wife called 911 and things fell apart, fast.

07.27.17 1:00 AM ET

When Louis Tramunti’s wife called 911, she wanted EMTs to save her husband’s life after a heart attack. Instead, two policemen threw him to the floor and broke his back. It was just one of those things; didn’t even make the papers.

Louis, an old friend of an old friend of mine, called me nearly a year later because “people need to know about this, bro,” which didn’t thrill his attorney.

“I’m not typically a PR lawyer,” said Steven Falkoff when I called. “It’s a basic fact pattern and excessive-force case. I don’t know how much sexiness there is for a broader story.”

To Louis—a good-natured if foul-mouthed 37-year-old Bernie-supporting son of Whitestone, a corner of Queens untouched by gentrification or even integration—it’s the only story.

He’s been married for seven years to Szilvia, a lovely Hungarian immigrant whose calmness evens out his off-the-walls hyperactivity, and he’s worked for more than 15 years as a plumbing surveyor, making good union wages mapping out where the sleeves go as new high-end Manhattan buildings rise up. Wherever Louis works now, he etches the name of their 2-year-old son, Marco, behind where the wall will be on each floor. The job puts him on top of half-finished buildings, Manhattan stretched out before him. Being up there, he says, is what made him fear thunder.

The family lives 40 miles and a world from Henry Hill or Archie Bunker’s Queens, in a split-level house in leafy Yorktown Heights, Westchester, just past the Donald J. Trump State Park (yes, no kidding; Trump donated the land in 2006) and down the road from the Elks Lodge. Before that, they lived for eight years in an apartment a few miles away in Hartsdale.

That’s where they were on April Fool’s Day 2016, a Saturday, as Szilvia drove her car into Greenburgh to have an officer do a safety check on the child seat, since Marco—a big kid, like his dad—had to start facing front. Went to dinner with them, put Marco to sleep, and went to bed herself.

Early Sunday morning, in the midst of a huge storm, the police came to them.

The thunder woke up Szilvia, and she heard a weird, loud groan and turned to shush Louis, who she figured was once again being some sort of goofy. She sees that he’s on his stomach shaking, sweating up a storm and drooling all over himself, not responding to her and still making the weird groan. So she called 911 (“for the first time in my life,” she later told The Daily Beast. “I’m a shy person”) and told the operator her husband’s having a heart attack.

She’s still on the line when the EMTs arrived, standing at the open front door of their apartment with Marco in her arms and a drop of blood on her shirt from a stress-induced nosebleed. The first responders saw her and then Louis, all 6 feet and 200 pounds of him, lurching in his underwear and walk away, telling the Greenburgh Police Officers en route to step on it.

Two officers get there and see Louis standing against a wall, eyes open but not responding to them. They approach, shine a light in his eyes, and just as he comes to and realizes they’re there, “I’m landing on my back and hitting my head at the same time.

“They had my arms pinned and their knees to my chest and they’re still shining the light in my eyes, and I’m just coming to and then they turn me around and squeeze my elbows together behind my back, and one of them has a knee in my back, and my legs go numb. I tell them I can’t breathe but the knee’s still there. I hear something crack and they crisscross my hands and cuff them and pull me up by the back and my chest starts killing me.

“They’re not saying anything to me, just dragging me out the door and Marco’s on the couch watching and someone’s saying to my wife ‘Don’t sugarcoat it, honey, we know he beat you up.’ And then I’m outside, in my fucking underwear, in the fucking snow, before all my neighbors.”

“Now, they’re talking to me: ‘We know you beat your wife.’”

“And I’m thinking: ‘Are you fucking kidding me’?”

The EMTs get outside and an officer comes with them and cuffs Louis inside the ambulance.

“This cop is telling me: ‘Yeah you beat your wife up. Is that the kind of man you are?’’

“I’m crying. I mean, I’ve never laid a hand on my wife. I had a great day. We had dinner and I played Call of Duty and fell asleep on the couch. Went into our bed and held my wife and fell back asleep. Wake up and there are the police taking me down—boom!—and telling me I beat my wife.

“I’m licking my lips and someone tells me to fucking stop so I do and I feel nauseous. Then tells me not to throw up, or it’s going to a big problem. They put a bag over my mouth.

“I’m crying. Is this who I am? Last thing I knew, I was falling asleep.

“I remember one of them saying we have a possible fifty-fifty-one or whatever and it seemed so odd. Later I realized that meant they were reporting they had a crazy or deranged person.

“So we get to the White Plains Hospital and I’m cuffed to the gurney, screaming the whole time that my ribs are killing me and that I can’t breathe. The cop from my house is there, trying to play the good-guy role and telling me, ‘Honestly, you know you really did beat up your wife tonight. You beat your wife good.’

“This doctor comes in and asks me questions and hears the way I’m staggering in my speech and right away wants to see if I had a seizure.

“Later, they put all the wiring in my head, and they told me I’d had a seizure. My first one. In fact, I had all the signs of one, bro, that the EMTs should have recognized. My wife didn’t say that when she called 911, because she’s not a doctor.

“Then they found I had four fractured vertebrae. I was in so much pain from my back and then on so much pain medication that I didn’t realize, and the doctors didn’t find until days later, that I’d also torn the tendon between my chest and my ribs.

That was long after “the cop, the same one who kept telling me I’d beaten my wife, finally took the cuffs off me.

“He said, ‘Sorry buddy. You’ll be OK.’ And then he left.”

No charges were filed.

Here’s how the night’s events come out in the colder, more cautious language of official reports. Remember everything that follows (and is sic’d throughout) is in response to Szilvia’s call to 911 saying her husband was having a heart attack:

Narrative: U/A find Pt on scene inside residence Awake and alert but non verbal standing up against the living room. Pt not responding to verbal stimuli or commands. Pt sweating, appears frightened and acting bizarre. Listed officer and Officer Maiden placed pt in restraints for pt’s safety and others on the scene. After pt was placed in cuffs he began responded to Officers. Pt reports he does not remeber getting out of bed and that the last thing he remembers wass going to sleep and then being in hand cuffs with Officers. Pt denies pain or discomfort. Pt placed on stretcher and into ambulance… Further als assessment waived in favor of patient being transported to the appropriate facility for a psych evaluation. While enroute the pt made statements like, “is this real”, as if parnoid.Pt care tansferred to stall.

Wife on scene reports her husband awoke from bed after a loud ligthing strike sound was heard outside during a storm. Pt would not listen to her and was roaming around the apartment as if he was terrified. Wife reports pt has never acted like this before and that he does not abuse drugs or alcohol. Wife reports pt was acting normal before going to bed the evening and that everything was normal.

From the police Incident/Investigation Report, about responding to “a possible ‘heart attack’”:

On approach to the residence, the Undersigned and PO Freeman observed a Greenville Fire Captain run out of the premise and state, “He is acting up in there, you better get in fast!”

On entering, the officers observed a middle aged man wearing only his boxers standing in the landing of the kitchen… (and) a white female and a young child standing in the livingroom. Both the child and the female appeared to be afraid. It should also be noted that the female was bleeding from the nose and had blood on her shirt and there were some blood droplets on the floor.

At this point, PO Freeman attempted to make vocal contact with the unknown male (later identified: as (PT) Tramunti, Louis) with negative result. The male only stared blankly at officers while sweating profusely and looking back and forth in an agitated state and obviously acting bizarre. At this time, PO Freeman and the undersigned, for the safety of the officers and all other people on the scene, decided to achieve control of the non-vocal and non-compliant PT by placing him in handcuffs and then placing him on the floor so that he could be properly assessed by PO Paramedic Freeman… The undersigned restrained PT’s legs in order to protect himself and officer freeman from being kicked during the assessment.

And from the supplemental report filed months later by the same officer, claiming that Louis “was awake and alert, sweating and appeared frightened” when the officers entered, It stresses that Szilvia and Marco, too, “appeared frightened” and that there was blood on her shirt and “droplets” on the floor:

Despite reporting that Louis was “awake and alert,” it continues: PT did not reply to verbal communication… was acting bizarre and appeared agitated. (PT stared blankly, back and forth at Officers as if confused. While on the floor in a supine position listed Officer assessed the (PT)’s vital signs… and obvious signs of trauma, which all appeared normal.

…

“When in the back of the ambulance (PT) came out of his trance like state and began asking what happened. … (PT) stated, “is this real” numerous times as if paranoid. (PT) kept asking what had happened after being told numerous times by listed Offiicer. (PT) did not complain of injury or pain other than discomfort from the hand cuffs that remained on him during the transport to the hospital.

Louis—who spent six weeks recovering before going back to work—and Szilvia are suing after rejecting a settlement offer.

Asked about the suit, Greenburgh Police Chief Chris McNerney emailed: “We are committed to vigorously defending yet another frivolous lawsuit against a police department. We are looking forward to the facts being presented in a court of law, as there is not one credible piece of evidence to support this outrageous claim.”

Also looking forward to an accounting and a judgment is Louis, who’s still fuming 15 months later about falling asleep with his family and waking up with his back broken, being told he’d beat his wife.

“On a work site,” he says, if a storm is coming and the winds get above 25 miles per hour, you get everyone off the roof to keep them safe and, in the process, ensure your own bottom line. How is it that cops,” he asks, “are held to such a lower bar?”

He’s furious that the department’s new body-camera program hadn’t rolled out when the police showed up at his door. About how, if he loses the suit, he may have to pay the department’s legal fees. “They have the nerve to do this. That’s intimidation. That’s bullshit.”

And he’s worried about his sex life—“I’m an Italian guy from Queens who was in a body cast. It is what it is, and it isn’t good”—while Szilvia’s worried about his health and earnings to support Marco and, she hopes, his future siblings.

The legal issue here is a much narrower one, says Falkoff, Louis’ lawyer, “focused on the amount of force they used in arresting him and the perceptions of the officers as it’s unfolding. This wasn’t 20 minutes but 15 or 20 seconds. EMS tells the cops to get in there fast, because they see the wife bleeding and Louis out of it. Cops get there and maybe it’s reasonable to take Louis down to the floor when he doesn’t respond. It’s the amount of force they used to take him down that’s the issue here.”

For Louis, it comes down to right and wrong.

“I never, ever beat anybody up, been drunk in public, had any issue with the police, done anything. I live for my son and my wife, my family, and I work hard. I don’t expect this to happen to me or anybody for that matter.

“How is it that no one can say, ‘We’re sorry and that was wrong’?”

“It’s insane. I have to see doctors and a physical therapist and also someone for PTSD now. I’m back at work, but I can’t talk about it with anyone there. There’s no support group for this. And when I tell my black friend, he just says ‘that’s how it is.’

“That’s not right. That’s not how it should be. I’m trying to tell white people: They’re coming for you, too, bro.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    World news in pictures

Video footage showed the tank accelerate to meet the car as it raced towards the checkpoint.

The tank retreated as civilians ran for cover, at which point the car exploded and nearby civilians were caught in the blast.

An army spokesman said the attack could have killed 50-60 people had it reached its target.

“The explosion was large, carrying about 100kg of high explosives,” the statement said.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

An insurgency in Egypt's Sinai region has gained pace since the army toppled President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's oldest Islamist movement, following mass protests against his rule in mid-2013.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A 50-year-old German man has been killed and six people injured in a knife attack in a Hamburg supermarket, German police say.

Police said the suspect was 26 years old and born in the United Arab Emirates. They said he acted alone and he was overpowered by passersby.

It was too soon to pinpoint a motive, they tweeted.

There are unconfirmed reports that he shouted "Allahu akhbar", Arabic for "God is great" while attacking people.

Police said they were still seeking to confirm his current nationality.

The man attacked customers in the supermarket at random, ran outside and was chased by customers and by people outside the shop. They brought him to the ground before he was detained by plain-clothes police officers.

A 50-year-old woman and four men aged between 19 and 64 were stabbed, while a 35-year-old man was injured while helping overcome the suspect.

The attack happened in the Barmbek region in the north of the city in a branch of Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket chain.

Police say the man's weapon may have looked like a machete but they are, for now, assuming it was a kitchen knife.

One eyewitness made a gesture about 50cm (20 in) long when asked on German TV how big the knife was.

Asked whether this was a terror attack, a police official told the BBC: "We are at an early stage of the investigation... At the moment we can't rule anything out. We are investigating all avenues."

Speculation in German media said the attack may have been part of a robbery attempt but police said that that motive could not be confirmed.

One eyewitness, who ran from the scene into a nearby shop as the situation unfolded, told German broadcaster NTV that it seemed "hectic and confused, not like a properly planned attack".

The newspaper reported that the child and her mother are also set to be prosecuted under the Child Marriages Restraint Act, which sets the minimum marriageable age of a female at 16.

The charity Girls not Brides believes that 21 per cent of Pakistani women are married by the age of 18, often with little say in the matter.

The Pakistani National Assembly rejected a proposal to raise the minimum marriageable age for females to 18, in line with that for males.

In a recent series of widely criticised rulings, the Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional body which gives Islamic legal advice to the Pakistani Government, declared that laws prohibiting child marriage are un-Islamic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    If approved, the rate increase would be phased in over two years. The first increase would occur in the summer of 2018 and the full rate would go into affect in early 2019. I&M says a residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month would see an increase of less than $1 per day.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration the average Indiana household averaged 964 kilowatt hours per month in 2015.

“I&M’s plan prepares the company for a future of energy generation that is more diverse and will allow us to offer our customers new, cleaner energy options. The plan will improve customers’ service through investments in infrastructure that will reduce outages and directly limit service interruptions caused by severe weather,” said Toby Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer of I&M. “We intend to better serve our communities by renovating aging equipment, modernizing the delivery system with new technology and improving the reliability of service while being mindful of the cost impacts on our customers.”

The Building the Future program would also allow the utility to create a systematic, four-year tree trimming program. I&M says the number one source of customer outages is trees and other vegetation.

If approved, the rate increase would give I&M an additional $263 million a year in revenue.

I&M asked for a rate increase in 2011 but was only awarded about half of its proposal by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

Also, I&M wants to increase the minimum customer charge, also called a fixed charge. That increase would go from $7.30 to $18. The minimum charge increase would be on top of the base rate increase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    www.journalgazette.net

Shepherd's House grant denied

VA mute as to reason; director of homeless vets center stunned

BRIAN FRANCISCO | The Journal Gazette

Shepherd's House, a Fort Wayne faith-based organization that provides transitional housing�for homeless military veterans, might launch a community fund drive, curtail�its services or close its doors because of the pending loss of federal funds.

Shepherd's House co-founder Barb Cox said Thursday that the Department of Veterans Affairs apparently has denied its application for a grant worth about $496,000 a year. A similar grant has�accounted for the bulk�of the organization's $622,000 yearly budget, with the rest coming from private sources.

“We're just completely thrown for a loop, honestly,” Cox said in a telephone interview.

“We've given everything for this ministry for the last�20 years, and we've seen miracle after miracle. ... I can't even let my mind ponder God not moving and making this possible again,” she said.

Shepherd's House has�40 beds for VA-qualified homeless veterans at its Tennessee Avenue building�near Spy Run. It has been receiving grant money since 2009 through VA's�Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program, called GPD for short. The grant amounts to $46 a day for each veteran served.

VA announced�in December that it would terminate�GPD�grants dating back to 1994 and�require recipients to reapply for funding by April 4.�VA said in its termination notice that it would turn the GPD into a competitive, performance-based yearly grant program.�Existing grants expire Sept.�30, and funds�will run out Dec.�31.

“We were told clearly�that 97 percent of all the existing programs would be funded, and we knew we couldn't fall in that (remaining) 3 percent because we're not just a cot and a meal, we've got a huge clinical treatment program here,” Cox said about Shepherd's House.

She said judges from a half-dozen court systems “will only refer here, because this program is so good. I never expected not to be funded.”

Cox said she�has never received written�notice from VA that the Shepherd's House grant application had been�rejected. She said she called a VA employee�in Tampa, Florida, to ask about the application and was told, “Oh, it's not good.”

VA officials in Washington, D.C., had not responded to requests for comment by Thursday night.

Liberty Landing, a transitional housing complex for homeless veterans on South Calhoun Street, received word that�its GPD application�had been approved, according to its owner, faith-based�Volunteers of America of Indiana. Mike Lloyd, vice president of operations for the Indianapolis-based Volunteers,�said�he did not know how much VA money the�40-bed facility would receive.

Asked about the future of Shepherd's House without federal funds, Cox said�one prospect is “really, really scaling back”�medical, psychological and other services for homeless veterans.�Another option is asking for�financial contributions from Fort Wayne�organizations, foundations and residents.

“I'm praying that the community steps up�and somehow makes this go on,” she said.

Asked whether�closing is an option, Cox said: “Well, we're 30,000 square feet. You can't make an operation this big continue without funding. So I don't want to say those words out loud, but I mean, it's just obvious.”

Rep. Jim Banks, R-3rd, wrote�a letter Wednesday to VA Secretary David Shulkin seeking details on the agency's decision to deny GPD funding to Shepherd's House. He wrote�that “to date no official explanation for this decision has been provided.”

Banks, a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, noted in his letter that Cox and her husband, Shepherd's House co-founder Lonnie Cox, received�Indiana's highest civilian honor, the Sagamore of the Wabash, from�then-Gov. Mike Pence, now the nation's vice president, in 2016.

While applauding VA efforts to improve its services for homeless veterans, Banks added,�“In the wake of these changes, organizations are running out of time to navigate a course for the future.” He wrote�that Indianapolis-based Hoosier Veteran Assistance Foundation did not get an official explanation for a reduction in its�GPD funding.

Banks is�not the only member of Congress�trying to get answers. The Journal Times of Racine County, Wisconsin, reported last week that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis.,�have�written to�Shulkin�to ask why their state's veterans affairs agency�has lost a $500,000 federal VA grant for aiding homeless veterans.

VA said last year on its website that the GPD has supported more than 600 homeless veterans projects and 13,800 beds nationwide. The program served roughly 44,700 homeless veterans in fiscal 2016, with more than 16,500 of them finding permanent housing, according to the website.

The�VA notice to terminate grants stated that�the agency “expects to fund 24 existing service centers and 12,000 beds” under its new plan, in which grants would fit�five housing models. Shepherd's House had applied under the clinical and hospital-to-housing models, while Liberty Landing applied under bridge housing for short stays and service-intensive transitioning.�

The December VA notice stated�that “the�allocation of these grants needs to be�updated to reflect the documented�current need as well as to increase the�flexibility to adapt to future needs.”

The nation's homeless veteran population declined�by nearly 50�percent�between�2010�and 2016, when it was about 39,400,�according to federal estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    LARGO — Police say the father whose 8-month-old was left in a bedroom with no air conditioning was told the day before the infant's death to keep his children in another room.

William Francis Hendrickson, 25, now faces several charges after police found his son lifeless in a playpen on Thursday.

The bedroom at the S Belcher Road mobile home was 109 degrees when police arrived. The baby's body temperature was 105.6 degrees and Hendrickson's daughter, 2, was immediately sent to Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital for dehydration, according to a police affidavit.

Police said they performed CPR on the boy until paramedics arrived. The infant could not be resuscitated and died at the scene.

Meanwhile, the children's mother sat in a jail cell, arrested days earlier on a battery charge.

About 12:30 p.m. on Thursday, Largo police officers responded to assist Pinellas County Child Protection investigators with a welfare check on the two children at the King's Manor Estates mobile home park at 1399 S Belcher Rd. lot 112.

Child services had told the father the day before not to leave the children in the bedroom, police said, but Hendrickson said he had "no where else to go" after his girlfriend was arrested the week before on charges she fought with his mother.

"He kept the children confined in the bedroom with him to avoid his live-in parents," police wrote.

On Saturday, the children's mother, Elizabeth Michelle Rutenbeck, 24, was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of battery. According to an arrest report, Rutenbeck tried to force her way into Hendrickson's mother's bedroom in the mobile home.

"The defendant then pushed through the victim to get an Xbox from inside the victim's room," the report says.

Rutenbeck was booked into the Pinellas County jail. Already on probation for felony charges of grand theft, she is being held without bail.

Two days later, Hendrickson's mother, Carrie Hendrickson, filed a domestic violence petition against Rutenbeck. She identified Rutenbeck as her son's "baby mama." In it, Carrie Hendrickson wrote that Rutenbeck injured her neck and knee and that a door she damaged needs to be replaced.

"All her belongings need to be removed from premises," she wrote.

On Friday at 10 a.m., detectives knocked on the mobile home's door. The woman who answered barked, "My grandson is dead because you did not do your job," before allowing them inside.

Hendrickson faces charges of aggravated child neglect for the condition of his daughter and aggravated manslaughter in the death of his son, according to police. He has had no arrests prior to Thursday in Florida, records show.

Police said citizens need to be reminded of the dangers of Florida's scorching temperatures, particularly in confined or poorly ventilated spaces and "especially for children, the elderly, and those with special medical concerns."

Hendrickson was booked into Pinellas County Jail on Thursday night and is being held on $150,000 bail.

Mike Bobbitt has lived one lot down from the Hendrickson's cream colored and red-trimmed home for 15 years.

LONDON — Charlie Gard, the critically ill British baby at the center of a legal battle that attracted the attention of Pope Francis and U.S. President Donald Trump, has died. He would have turned 1 next week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “The State is ordered to comply with the DEA’s administrative subpoena within 21 days of issuance of this Order or face contempt sanctions upon motion made by the DEA,” U.S. District Court Judge David Nuffer wrote in the order.

The Utah Attorney General’s Office told FOX 13 on Friday it was reviewing the opinion and any potential options for appeal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    North Korea has fired an an intercontinental ballistic missile which may have landed in Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), according to the country's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

The zone reaches 200 nautical miles from the country's coast. Mr Abe has called an emergency meeting of the National Security Council.

"I have received information that North Korea once again conducted a missile firing," Mr Abe said. "We will immediately analyze information and do our utmost to protect the safety of the Japanese people."

He called on the US, South Korea, Russia and China to increase pressure on the secretive state over its missile launches, which have defied international rulings.

Trump on North Korea: There are consequences for their bad behaviour

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan "absolutely cannot tolerate" repeated provocations from North Korea, also known as the DPRK.

Soon after reports of the launch emerged from Japan, the Pentagon and South Korean military officials confirmed they detected a ballistic missile launch from North Korea.

On Friday evening, Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said: "The US Department of Defence detected and tracked a single North Korea missile launch today. We assess that this missile was an intercontinental ballistic missile, as had been expected.

"The missile was launched from Mupyong-ni and travelled about 1,000km before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. We are working with our interagency partners on a more detailed assessment.

"The North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.

"Our commitment to the defence of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad. We are prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation."

Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis said the lengthy flight time meant the missile was likely a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), potentially capable of travelling 10,000km and hitting a target in the US.

According to Yonhap news agency, South Korean military officials said the missile was launched from Jagang Province, in the north of the DPRK.

South Korea has also called a national security meeting.

The night time launch of the ICBM was unusual, as most take place around dawn. Dr. John Nilsson-Wright, senior research fellow on Chatham House's Asia programme, told The Independent this could have been to demonstrate the military was capable of launching in varying conditions.

Alternatively, Dr Nilsson-Wright said, "maybe the element of surprise is part of the reason why they wanted to do this".

He added: "I think they've shown that they have the capability, the increased technical sophistication, and I think there will be a lot of anxiety in Seoul and Tokyo."

It comes just one day after the 64th anniversary of the end of the Korean War -- known as Victory Day in the North.

International tensions have been mounting over the nuclear ambitions of North Korea in recent months, and Donald Trump has threatened to "take care" of the unstable situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Just over two years after candidate Donald Trump mocked John McCain's Vietnam War record, noting that he prefers heroes "who weren't captured", the Arizona senator stuck a dagger in President Trump's healthcare reform plans.

There were gasps when Mr McCain, after being furiously lobbied by Vice-President Mike Pence, joined two other Republican senators in voting against the so-called "skinny" repeal plan, considered the bare minimum Senate Republicans could agree on.

Instead of a big step toward becoming law - either in its skinny form or after further negotiations with the House of Representatives - the future of Obamacare repeal has been thrown into doubt.

The reality is, for now, there is no minimum level of change on which Senate Republicans can agree. They either have to work with Democrats or resign themselves to stalemate and move on to other topics, like taxes or infrastructure spending.

It will take some time for the scale of this late-night Senate drama to sink in. No one really expected Mr McCain to be the decisive vote, but the man who once had a reputation as a Republican "maverick", now facing a dire brain cancer diagnosis, had at least one more surprise in his pocket.

What was the 'skinny repeal'?

The bill - officially known as the Health Care Freedom Act - would have eliminated parts of Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act - including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage or pay a fine, and the employer mandate, which requires the same of companies with 50 employees or more.

It also would have temporarily repealed a tax on medical devices, defund the US women's group Planned Parenthood for a year and provide more money to community health centres, as well as given states more flexibility in complying with Obamacare regulations.

But the pared-down measure would have left much of Obamacare untouched, including the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for the poor that faced deep cuts in earlier proposals.

A requirement that all insurance plans cover essential health benefits, federal subsidies to help consumers pay for insurance as well as taxes on wealthy Americans also would have remained in place.

The stripped down bill came after earlier Senate defeats for proposals to replace Obamacare and then to partially repeal it.

Sen McCain said he had voted against the skinny repeal because it did not amount to meaningful reform and would not have improved care for Americans.

He added that House Speaker Paul Ryan's assurance that the House would be willing to send the bill for further consideration by committee "did not ease my concern that this shell of a bill could be taken up and passed at any time".

What now for Obamacare?

There are not thought to be any further plans for a new bill to repeal Obamacare because the skinny repeal was seen as the only measure Republicans could get through Congress.

However, lawmakers could revive the issue and take it up later in the year.

Following the vote, President Trump tweeted: "As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal."

Mr Trump's position on healthcare reform has varied - he has spoken out at various points for Obamacare being repealed, repealed and replaced, or being allowed to collapse by itself.

In his statement, Mr McCain said Obamacare was in a state of "collapse", with healthcare premiums "skyrocketing" and providers "fleeing the marketplace".

He criticised the way Obamacare had been passed by Democrats using their Obama-era majority and called for senators to "return to the correct way of legislating" with input from both parties.

"We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) project called “Imperial” included three hacking tools for infiltrating the Mac and Linux operating systems, according to the latest “Vault 7” leaks.

Cyber danger, Will Robinson!

Finnish cyber security expert Mikko Hyppönen talks about security in the Nordics, Russia and the trouble with connected devices; Icelandic airline Wow Air averted disaster through the use of application performance monitoring software when it embarked on a major expansion; and find out how, since December 2015, anyone playing popular sandbox game Minecraft has been able to build their worlds on the actual map of Sweden.

WikiLeaks claims that a source provided portions of an archive of the CIA’s hacking arsenal, including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponised “zero day” exploits and malware remote control systems that was circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorised manner.

The latest documents to be leaked detail hacking tools called Achilles, Aeris and SeaPea.

According to the documents, Achilles is aimed at enabling CIA agents to “trojan an [Mac] OS X disk image (.dmg) installer with one or more desired operator specified executables for a one-time execution”.

SeaPea is designed to function as a Mac OS X rootkit for versions 10.6 and 10.7 to allow CIA agents to infiltrate a system while it reboots to carry out monitoring operations and launch tools.

SeaPea’s manual was previously released by WikiLeaks in another Vault 7 release named DarkSeaSkies, which detailed hacking tools targeting Macs and iPhones.

Aeris is described as an automated implant written in the C programming language that targets Linux distributions, including Debian, Red Hat, Solaris, FreeBSD and CentOS.

The documents claim Aeris is designed to function as a backdoor to these Linux distributions and can be used to build customised implants tailored for specific operations.

There is a lot of “fog” surrounding cyber weapons and cyber war because there is no way of knowing the true capability of any country, says security expert Mikko Hypponen.

Aeris supports “automated file exfiltration, configurable beacon interval and jitter, standalone and Collide-based HTTPS LP support and SMTP protocol support – all with TLS encrypted communications with mutual authentication”, according to WikiLeaks.

WikiLeaks says the documents indicate the scope of the CIA’s global covert hacking programme, its malware arsenal and dozens of “zero day” weaponised exploits against a wide range of US and European company products.

WikiLeaks claims that since 2001, the CIA has gained political and budgetary pre-eminence over the US National Security Agency (NSA) and built its own group of hackers.

By the end of 2016, says WikiLeaks, the CIA’s hacking division had more than 5,000 registered users and had produced more than 1,000 hacking systems, trojans, viruses and other “weaponised” malware, creating, in effect, its “own NSA” but with “even less accountability”.

WikiLeaks said the source of the Vault 7 leaks suggested there were policy questions that urgently needed to be debated in public, including whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.

“The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons,” said WikiLeaks.

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo and Co said it would reimburse about $80 million to 570,000 customers who may have been charged wrongly due to issues related to auto collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies.

Wells Fargo has been engulfed in scandal since September, when it reached a $190 million settlement with regulators over complaints that its retail banking staff had opened as many as 2.1 million unauthorized client accounts.

The bank had fired 5,300 employees for improper sales tactics over five years, but did not make much changes to policies and procedures, or hold managers accountable until there was a public outcry.

Wells Fargo said late Thursday it would pay back $80 million to customers wrongly charged for car loan insurance in the coming months, which included $64 million in cash and $16 million of account adjustments.

"We take full responsibility for our failure to appropriately manage the CPI program and are extremely sorry for any harm this caused our customers," said Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo Consumer Lending.

The bank said it had started a review of the CPI program in July 2016 and discontinued the program in September, based on the findings.

New York Times reported earlier that more than 800,000 people who took car loans from Wells Fargo were charged for auto insurance they did not need, and some of the customers were still paying for it. nyti.ms/2tIdyUE

About 490,000 customers had duplicate vehicle insurance coverage and about 60,000 customers did not receive complete disclosures from vendors, prior to CPI coverage, Wells Fargo said.

For about 20,000 customers, additional costs of the CPI could have led to defaults resulting in seizure of their vehicles. The bank said these customers would receive additional payments as compensation for the loss of their vehicles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will explore cutting the level of nicotine in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels, a radical step that would reshape the $130 billion American tobacco industry and potentially encourage millions of people to quit smoking.

The move, announced Friday, would represent one of the most sweeping federal efforts to reduce smoking since Congress required cigarette packages to carry health warnings in 1965. It follows other moves by President Donald Trump’s FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to try and deal with the high cost of prescription drugs and opioid addiction, two issues not directly within the agency’s traditional mandate.

Tobacco stocks plunged after the announcement, which came just hours after the failure of Republicans’ effort to repeal and replace much of the Affordable Care Act. The FDA’s move is likely to set off a lobbying fight in Washington, even as it pushes the industry to move faster in the development of new products that rely less on burning tobacco and more on potentially lower-risk technologies like vaping.

“The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes -- the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users,” Gottlieb said in a statement announcing the move. “Unless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.”

Gottlieb also said regulators will look at banning menthol and flavored-products because of their potential for attracting young people. An administration official said the White House supports the move, and disagreed that it was a break from Trump’s anti-regulation agenda.

Tobacco Innovation

In a briefing Friday, he called nicotine both the “problem” and “ultimately, the solution.” Along with nicotine reduction, the FDA plans to ease the path of entry for less-harmful nicotine delivery systems. The FDA “must also recognize potential for innovation to lead to less harmful products,” Gottlieb said in the briefing.

“I’ve pledged a deep commitment to taking aggressive steps to address the epidemic of addiction to opioids,” Gottlieb said. “I view our opportunity to confront addiction to nicotine with the same obligation. I’ll pursue efforts to reduce addiction to nicotine with the same vigor.”

While reducing nicotine is bad news for the cigarette business, the impact could be tempered for companies like Philip Morris International Inc. and Altria Group Inc., which have been putting more emphasis on innovations they say have less health risks. Philip Morris has spent over $3 billion on developing its reduced-risk portfolio.

“This was a big surprise and will make it imperative that domestic tobacco companies strive to develop innovative, safer products,” said Jack Russo, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. who follows the tobacco industry.

Shares of Altria dropped as much as 19 percent, the biggest intraday decline since 1999. British American Tobacco’s stock fell as much as 14 percent.

“Until the eventual development of specific proposals, it’s too early to understand the practical implications,” said Simon Evans, a spokesman for Imperial Brands Plc, a Bristol, U.K.-based tobacco manufacturer that sells Winston and Kool cigarettes. Shares of the company fell as much as 9.5 percent.

Unexpected

The move caught some in Washington by surprise. Representative Robert Aderholt, the Alabama Republican who runs the congressional subcommittee overseeing the FDA budget, said Gottlieb called earlier in the day to give him a heads up on the new policy.

“I’m still trying to get my arms around it,” said Aderholt.

The Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-smoking advocacy group that’s been active in past tobacco regulatory changes, said it didn’t get a preview of the announcement. Staff were gathered in a conference room watching Gottlieb’s announcement when they got the news, Becky Wexler, a spokeswoman, said via email.

FDA Authority

The FDA gained oversight of tobacco products in 2009 through the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The law said that agency had “the authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other harmful components of tobacco products.”

Developing regulations around the proposal will take time, and is likely to create fierce debate.

“The FDA plans to begin a public dialogue about lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to nonaddictive levels through achievable product standards,” the agency said in the announcement.

Representatives of Philip Morris and Altria didn’t respond to requests for comment. British American Tobacco’s Reynolds American division said it was encouraged by the move and that the FDA had recognized “tobacco harm reduction policies and the continuum of risk for tobacco products.”

Sales of cigarettes have already been in decline, hurt in part by rising taxes. The industry’s cigarette sales volume dropped an estimated 4.5 percent last quarter, Altria reported earlier this week. The average state excise tax was $1.74 per pack last quarter, compared with 19 cents for the same time last year, according to Altria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A congressional information technology staffer was arrested Monday evening before a scheduled flight for Lahore, Pakistan, and charged with bank fraud in connection with a $165,000 loan from the congressional Federal Credit Union, authorities said.

Imran Awan, 37, pleaded not guilty Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey in Washington and was released to a high-intensity supervision program whose conditions include GPS monitoring, a nighttime curfew and staying within a 50-mile radius of his home in Lorton, federal prosecutors said. He was arrested at Dulles International Airport, his attorney said.

Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, allegedly secured a $165,000 home equity loan in January from CFCU on a house in Alexandria after claiming it was their primary residence, when it was a rental property, FBI Special Agent Brandon C. Merriman wrote in an affidavit for Awan’s arrest. The couple told the credit union to wire the money to Pakistan for use in purchasing a property, Merriman wrote.

Alvi, also a former House IT worker, and the couple’s three school-aged children, were approached by federal agents but allowed to board a flight to Lahore on March 5 Merriman wrote, but he said that he “does not believe that Alvi has any intention to return to the United States.”

Awan’s attorney, Chris Gowen, said in a statement, “Because we are confident in the integrity of the U.S. justice system, we are confident that Mr. Awan will soon be able to clear his name and get on with his life. Neither Mr. Awan nor his wife have ever had any intention to ‘flee’ the United States.”

“They are U.S. citizens who have built a full life and have a strong community life in this country. They will stand and fight whatever charges are presented,” Gowen said. The couple had round trip tickets, and Awan had informed the government of his plans to travel, Gowen said.

Awan had worked for the House since 2004 as a shared employee, getting paid about $165,000 per year from about a dozen Democratic members in 2015 and 2016, for example, according to Legistorm. Most payments ended by early February, the congressional data tracking service reported.

Awan worked most recently for U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), before he was fired Tuesday, her spokesman said.

“Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,” David Damron said.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office of the District and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Capitol Police declined to comment, citing the pending case.

Border officers appeared to encourage teen to drink from bottle containing liquid meth

A government surveillance video obtained by ABC News has shed new light on a tragic incident at the U.S.-Mexico border, sparking outrage from members of Congress who help oversee U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The video shows that in 2013 two U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers appeared to encourage, or at least permit, a 16-year-old Mexican high school student to drink from a bottle that tests would later reveal contained concentrated liquid methamphetamine.

The young man, Cruz Velazquez, died within two hours of drinking the substance, but the two officers involved, Valerie Baird and Adrian Perallon, remain on the job today, with no disciplinary action taken against them.

A former head of internal affairs at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, James Tomsheck, told ABC News the two officers violated agency protocols by allowing the young man to drink from the bottle, and that he was told at the time they would be punished.

"If they truly suspected there was a controlled substance in the bottle," Tomsheck said, "they should've conducted a field test."

Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California and the ranking member on the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, condemned the officers' conduct.

"Drug smuggling is wrong and is a crime, but this teenage boy did not deserve a death sentence," Lofgren told ABC News. "For CBP officers to inflict a summary death sentence is not only immoral, but also illegal."

Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Missouri and the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, echoed those sentiments.

"In order for CBP officers to prevent smuggling, ensure public safety, and do their difficult job at the border properly, CBP must have the appropriate protocols in place and officers must follow them," Thompson told ABC News. "While there is no excuse for attempting to bring illicit substances into the country, it is absolutely clear from the video that there were numerous failures in judgement and procedure that led to the senseless death of a 16-year-old boy. CBP must ensure that such a tragedy never occurs again."

The video, which will air for the first time today on Good Morning America, World News Tonight with David Muir, 20/20 and Nightline as part of a year-long investigation of U.S. Customs and Border Protection conducted by ABC News and The Investigative Fund, shows that Velazquez took four drinks from the bottle, and the officers appear to repeatedly encourage him with hand gestures.

The Velazquez family ultimately filed a civil lawsuit against the officers and the agency, claiming that the officers' actions led to Cruz's death.

"What you see, I think, is a basic lack of compassion and decency toward a 16-year-old boy," said Gene Iredale, the San Diego-based attorney who represented the Velazquez family. "Almost a delight that you would see in children who just pull the wings off flies slowly, a smile when he's being asked to drink something and being put in this position."

Both officers, who declined through their attorneys to be interviewed by ABC News, denied asking Velazquez to drink from the bottle, and the official report called the incident an "accident." Officer Perallon claimed Velazquez "volunteered" to take a drink.

In response to the broader ABC News investigation, which revealed a history of cases in which the agency appeared to ignore accusations of mistreatment and abuse, the agency issued a statement, saying, "CBP takes all allegations of mistreatment seriously, and does not tolerate actions that are not consistent with our core values of vigilance, service to country and integrity."

The Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego released a brief statement to ABC News.

"The Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego provided consular and legal assistance to Mr. Cruz Velazquez's family since it learned about his death. This tragic incident highlights the need of greater transparency and accountability in immigration control activities."

Earlier this year, the U.S. government paid the teen's family $1 million to settle a lawsuit. There was no apology or admission of wrongdoing, and both officers testified that they never received a reprimand for their conduct, a fact that still angers members of Velazquez's family.

"How can the government allow that? It's like, OK you can kill someone," Reyna Velazquez, Cruz's sister, told ABC News. "They took him as a fool, as who cares. Well, that fool, he was the greatest person I ever knew."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A corrections officer was placed on administrative leave after pulling a gun on an ATV rider in North Pole while he was off duty.

According to the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, GoPro video footage taken May 29 by an all-terrain vehicle rider named Devarge Walker shows him riding down a gravel road when Gregory Braeuer, an off-duty corrections officer at the Fairbanks Correctional Center, gets out of his pickup, approaches Walker and says, "This ain't a racetrack."

Braeuer reaches for the ATV, and a struggle ensues. Walker tells Braeuer to "get the f–k off my bike. The f–k's wrong with you?" Braeuer responds, "What's wrong with you?"

Then Braeuer goes back to his truck, takes out a gun and walks toward Walker.

"Get on the ground right now," Braeuer says. After that point the GoPro camera moves and is facing part of the ATV. Braeuer references his badge and repeats himself: "Get on the f–king ground." Walker gets on the ground.

An argument ensues, and Walker tells Braeuer he is being recorded. Walker's friends are also heard talking.

Braeuer "is currently on administrative leave pending further administrative hearings," Alaska Department of Corrections spokesperson Megan Edge said in an email.

She said Alaska State Troopers are investigating the incident, as well as the DOC professional conduct unit.

"Correctional officers do not have the authority to detain anyone outside of a correctional facility," Edge said in the email. "Correctional officers are also not authorized to carry firearms in the course of their duties. As a private citizen, Mr. Braeuer does have the right to carry a firearm."

The News-Miner reported that Walker was charged with fourth-degree assault on July 5, and Braeuer "has not been charged."

Charlie Gard, the baby whose fate was the subject of a protracted court battle and made headlines around the world, has died, his parents have said.

They fought a five-month campaign to have him transferred from Great Ormond Street hospital, where he was on life support for experimental treatment they hoped could give Charlie, who was blind and deaf and could not breath without a ventilator, “a meaningful life”. But they abandoned their legal battle on Monday, saying it was too late to save him. On Thursday he was transferred to an unspecified hospice and he died the next day, a week before he would have turned one, after having his life support systems withdrawn.

In a statement, Charlie’s mother, Connie Yates, said: “Our beautiful little boy has gone. We are so proud of you, Charlie.”

Prime Minister Theresa May said she was “deeply saddened” by his death and her “thoughts and prayers” were with his parents.

After his parents accepted he had no realistic prospect of improvement, blaming the deterioration in his muscles while they were battling Gosh, whose doctors believed the experimental treatment would not work and only prolong Charlie’s suffering the couple fought further battles against Gosh in increasingly acrimonious proceedings.

But in the face of opposition from Gosh, which said the invasive ventilation required by Charlie was not deliverable at home, they agreed with the hospital that he would be transferred to a hospice for his final hours.

But still the parties disagreed with the family wanting to keep him alive for several days but the hospital saying that would require a 24/7 intensive care team which was impossible to find for a hospice setting.

The judge, Mr Justice gave the parents time to find such a team but they were unsuccessful and he directed that an alternative plan should be put in place involving a much shorter time spent at the hospice on life support, the details of which were were not made public.

Hundreds of people, who called themselves Charlie’s Army, supported the campaign for him to receive treatment in the US, raising £1.35m.

A spokeswoman for Gosh said on Thursday: “The risk of an unplanned and chaotic end to Charlie’s life is an unthinkable outcome for all concerned and would rob his parents of precious last moments with him.

“As the judge has now ruled, we will arrange for Charlie to be transferred to a specialist children’s hospice, whose remarkable and compassionate staff will support his family at this impossible time.”

Charlie had a form of mitochondrial disease, a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage, although his parents claimed the hospital was wrong in saying he had already suffered severe irreversible brain damage. Yates and Gard also disputed with Gosh that their son was in pain.

Earlier this month, Pope Francis said he had been following the case closely and hoped that Charlie’s parents would be able to “accompany and treat their child until the end”. The Vatican children’s hospital also offered to take over his care from Gosh.

Shortly afterwards, Trump tweeted: “If we can help little Charlie Gard, as per our friends in the UK and the pope, we would be delighted to do so.”

Gard and Yates, both in their 30s from Bedfont, west London, went back to the high court this month after claiming they had new evidence of the prospects of the NBT therapy being successful. But at an emotional court hearing on Monday, which saw both parents in tears, as well as lawyers, members of the public and press said they were finally abandoning the case, paying tribute to Charlie as

“absolute warrior”.

In a statement, Yates read out from the witness box in the packed courtroom in central London, Yates said: “Mummy and Daddy love you so much, Charlie, we always have and we always will, and we are so sorry that we couldn’t save you. We had the chance, but we weren’t allowed to give you that chance. Sweet dreams baby. Sleep tight, our beautiful little boy.”

Yates said time had been wasted and “had Charlie been given the treatment sooner, he would have had the potential to be a normal, healthy little boy”.

But doctors at Gosh did not agree, with lawyers representing the hospital saying the “clinical picture” six months ago had shown irreversible damage to Charlie’s brain.

Over the course of the legal dispute, a worldwide campaign mobilised in support of Charlie’s parents, raising £1.3m. But some supporters made death threats, condemned by Francis and Gard and Yates, against Gosh doctors and staff. A hospital spokeswoman said on Friday: “Everyone at Great Ormond Street Hospital sends their heartfelt condolences to Charlie’s parents and loved-ones at this very sad time.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Police body cam footage of man tased in back prompts $110K settlement

However, police board said tasing was “reasonable, appropriate, and within policy.”

Body cam footage of an Aurora, Colorado, cop tasing an unarmed black man in the back paved the way for the city to pay $110,000 to settle police abuse allegations, the man's lawyers told Ars Thursday.

Footage from September's tasing shows two black men being questioned by police who are responding to a weapons incident at a nearby apartment building. One of the men is seen and overheard on the video demanding to know why he's being questioned. "For what... ?" he says.

The victim, Darsean Kelley, then appears to thump his chest with his right hand and yell, "I know my rights." He's then tased in the back, loses his faculties, and falls flat on his back. He begins screaming uncontrollably, according to the video. Adding insult to injury, he's also arrested, charged with failure to obey police, and then jailed for three days because he's unable to post bail.

Body cams and dash cams are increasingly being deployed by police in the aftermath of high-profile shootings in recent years. They're designed to record police actions to protect cops from false allegations, and they're also used for public accountability purposes. In this instance, the video prompted a legal settlement. At the same time, however, police said the video showed the officer was not out of line.

"The body camera footage was indispensable in securing justice for Darsean Kelley," John M. Krieger, a spokesman with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, told Ars. "Without irrefutable evidence of police misconduct captured on video, it would have been our client's word against multiple officers, and the truth about what happened to Darsean would almost certainly have never come to light."

The ACLU eventually convinced the authorities to drop the charges against Kelley. Its lawyers argued that their client was illegally detained when he was outside with his cousin. All the while, the Aurora Police Department has ruled the tasing as acceptable within department policy. The city said it was settling the legal claim (PDF) before a lawsuit was filed to avoid the expense of litigation.

Aurora City Attorney Mike Hyman said in a statement that the city settled so it wouldn’t have to spend even more taxpayer money defending a lawsuit.

"We disagree with the ACLU's characterization of the events in this case and their unwarranted attack against the Aurora Police Department," Hyman said Thursday. "This case was settled for the reason that many cases are settled—to avoid the cost of prolonged litigation. That cost would have far exceeded the value of the settlement."

The police department's internal review board cleared the cops of wrongdoing in October, concluding that the use of force "was reasonable, appropriate, and within policy." The officer who deployed the electronic device believed Kelley was reaching for a weapon.

When officers arrived in the area of the call they found an agitated Kelley yelling at another man and lawfully stopped him. After failing to obey numerous orders, Mr. Kelley was tased and subsequently arrested and charged in Aurora Municipal Court with ACC 94-110(5) Failure to Obey Lawful Orders.

The use of force applied against Mr. Kelley was later reviewed by the Force Review Board (FRB). The FRB is empaneled to review uses of force to determine compliance with Department Directives, procedures, and training. The FRB determined the force applied in this incident was within policy.

The ACLU said Kelley was not hospitalized. But in its claim for damages, the ACLU said that, because of the incident, Kelley has "developed a deep and lasting fear of the police."

WASHINGOTN: Two Sikh Americans have been killed in two separate incidents in one week in California, according to community organisations and media reports.

Subag Singh, 68, was found dead in a canal after he went missing in the morning of June 23. His body had injuries.

California law enforcement officials from Fresno county have said that they were trying to find out who was responsible for the killing of the elderly Sikh American.

"Deputies found his body with visible trauma in a canal on McCall and Jensen. Investigators are trying to piece together what led up to the body being found in a canal," Fox26 news said in a report.

Deputies are not saying if this was a hate crime or not, but members of the Sikh community say this would not be the first, it said.

"Honestly, we are very hurt, it just hurts us. And it just we then, think what else do we need to do," Gurdeep Shergill, a local community leader, was quoted as saying.

In a separate incident, Simranjit Singh, 20, of Elk Grove was shot dead on July 25 outside a gas station where he worked.

According to Sacramento Bee news, he was shot dead by men who had earlier assaulted his co-worker.

"At this point in both investigations, it is unclear if either of these crimes were racially motivated but we are working with both local and federal laws enforcement authorities to ensure these murders are thoroughly investigated and that the local jurisdictions are treating the cases with the utmost importance," said Sikh American Legal Defence and Education Fund (SALDEF).

"These attacks are inexcusable and we offer our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of Subag Singh and Simranjit Singh.

"We call upon local and federal law enforcement agencies to thoroughly investigate these heinous crimes and classify them as hate incidents if hate is show to be a motive," SALDEF executive director Baldev Singh said.

There have been a number of attacks targeting Indian- Americans and Sikhs in the recent months in the US.

In March, a 39-year-old Sikh man was shot in the arm outside his home in Kent, Washington, by a partially-masked gunman who shouted "go back to your own country".

In February, 32-year-old Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed when a US Navy veteran opened fire at him and his friend Alok Madasani, yelling "get out of my country"

‘It is just a beginning,’ Imran Khan, Pakistan's opposition leader and a petitioner in the high-profile Panama case, said as he hailed the Supreme Court's decision to disqualify Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Pakistan's Supreme Court disqualified 67-year-old Sharif for dishonesty and ruled that corruption cases be filed against him and his children over the Panama Papers scandal, forcing the embattled leader out of office.

Prosecutor: Martin Shkreli repeatedly lied to investors

Prosecutor: Martin Shkreli repeatedly lied to investors

NEW YORK (AP) — Wealthy investors say former biotech CEO Martin Shkreli told them he was managing tens of millions of dollars' worth of investments, that they were making double-digit returns and they could withdraw their money at any time.

Prosecutors in closing arguments Thursday at Shkreli's securities fraud trial said it was all a brazen con. The defense countered that no one should feel sorry for the alleged victims because they were high-rollers who ended up doubling or tripling their money.

Shkreli, 34, is best known for jacking up the price of a life-saving drug and trolling his critics on social media, but his trial in Brooklyn has focused on his time running a pair of hedge funds.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith told jurors Shkreli "lied to investors to get their money into the funds and then lied to them so they wouldn't take it out."

The prosecutor recounted testimony by investors who told jurors that Shkreli claimed to be managing up to $40 million in one of his firms at a time when its brokerage account held only a few hundred dollars. When one investor asked for his money back, Shkreli stalled for months until he used a Ponzi-like scheme to secretly raid a second fund to return a portion of the funds, she said.

"The defendant was lying not only about the ability to get a redemption, but also about where that money was coming from," she said.

As Shkreli was "blowing up" his hedge funds with bad stock picks, he continued to recruit new investors by portraying himself as a Wall Street whiz who graduated from Columbia University, Smith said. He really attended a lesser-known public university, Baruch College.

Claims "that he was some sort of genius in the investing industry were completely untrue," she said.

The defense has sought to portray the impish Shkreli as a misunderstood eccentric who slept on the floor of his office in a sleeping bag for two years while starting a successful drug company that allowed him to enrich his alleged victims.

"Who does that if you're committing a fraud and you have millions of dollars in people's money?" said his attorney, Ben Brafman. "He has no life. He's the hermit scientist."

Shkreli is "not a Ponzi guy who's taking money and buying a Cadillac or a yacht," the lawyer added at another point.

The lawyer agreed Shkreli could be annoying, saying, "In terms of people skills, he's impossible." But he claimed the clients who appeared as government witnesses were still eager to bet on him.

Investors "found him strange. They found him weird. And they gave him money. Why? Because they recognized genius," Brafman said.

Shkreli didn't testify, but throughout the trial he has used Facebook to bash prosecutors and news organizations covering his case, despite his lawyer's efforts to shut him up. In one recent post, he wrote, "This was a bogus case from day one."

The trial is in its fifth week. Jury deliberations could begin on Friday.

NEW YORK (AP) — Former pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli was portrayed both as a swindler by the government and as a well-meaning prodigy by his lawyers on the second day of closing arguments Friday at his securities fraud trial.

The trial in federal court in Brooklyn "has exposed Martin Shkreli for who he really is — a con man who stole millions," Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis told jurors.

Prosecutors allege that the 34-year-old Shkreli looted his drug company, Retrophin, of stock and cash so he could pay back disgruntled investors in a pair of failed hedge funds he ran. Investors testified that the defendant repeatedly lied to them about what was going on with their money.

The defense has argued that no one was victimized because Shkreli used his "genius" to make Retrophin a success and ensure investors doubled or even tripled their money.

"Who lost anything? Nobody," defense attorney Ben Brafman said in his closing argument. Some investors were forced to admit on the witness stand that partnering with Shkreli was "the greatest investment I've ever made," he added.

The lawyer also argued that a drug company official who testified for the government was biased. If Shkreli is found guilty of a felony, Brafman said, the company would have clear grounds for forcing him out as CEO in 2014 and would gain ammunition in its $65 million lawsuit against him. Shkreli claims he was wrongfully terminated and is owed millions.

With a guilty verdict, "Retrophin pops a Champagne cork," he said.

Shkreli became notorious for using another drug company to raise the price of a life-saving drug 5,000 percent and for trolling his critics on social media, where he's been dubbed "Pharma Bro."

The defendant didn't testify. But he made his thoughts on the case known on Facebook, where he called it "bogus."

The jury was expected to begin deliberating as soon as Friday afternoon.

'People fear what they don't understand': Culture clash with immigrants divides Pa. town

CALIFORNIA, Pa. -- Almost overnight they arrived, close to 100 Romanian immigrants who are members of a minority group called Roma, to take up residence in this small town along the Monongahela River.

If you've heard of California, it's probably because of the university. That's at one end of town, with brick buildings and bright colors. The rest of the town is filled with homes and businesses that are more time-worn, many of them built to house steelworkers and coal miners before those industries evaporated. Now they are home to their children, and grandchildren.

With a population of just about 6,700, it's a place where everyone knows everyone. But the presence of the newcomers, who arrived in May, seems to be tearing apart the bonds that have been built over generations.

"This is turning lifelong friends against each other," said Rebecca Daniels, who has lived in California her entire life. "I don't know if this can be fixed."

Immigrants took up residence in vacant, off-campus student housing -- particularly one rustic-looking apartment building where this week small, dark-haired children ran and played. Men in crisp polo shirts or clean, white button downs sat around tables and talked and smoked. Women, in long dresses, some wearing traditional Muslim head dressings, did the same, huddled on a long, splintered porch, apart from the men.

Some in California, many descended from immigrants, say they want to welcome their new neighbors and help them become a part of the community.

But others say the Roma -- sometimes referred to as gypsies --are different than the Italian Americans who came to town a handful of generations ago. Neighbors say - and loudly proclaimed at a recent borough council meeting - that the Roma refuse to assimilate, or even communicate, and have been wreaking havoc since their unexpected arrival.

They tell stories of Roma butchering chickens and defecating in public. Those stories recently gained attention when they were repeated on national television by Tucker Carlson, host of Fox News show "Tucker Carlson Tonight."

It's difficult to tell how and when this group of Roma got to the United States, but officials with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement say there are 97 of them living in California.

They are here unlawfully, officials say, and are part of ICE's Alternative to Detention Program, which allows them to remain in the community as they await court hearings and final orders to stay or to be deported back to Romania.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services could not confirm that the Roma are seeking asylum since those applications are confidential, but one Roma who briefly spoke with PennLive said that is why they are here - seeking asylum from persecution in their home country, something these nomadic people have suffered across Europe for decades, even centuries.

She said her name is Dochia.

She appeared to be in her late 20s and drank Coca Cola out of a wine glass as she smoked a cigarette. She was surrounded by several older women and spoke on the condition that no photos would be taken. During the interview Wednesday evening, a half-dozen children ran around the yard, shouting and playing.

That's why she came to the United States, she said. For the children.

"In my country, no help for kids," Dochia said. "I want to make good life in America with kids."

When she mentioned her home country, an older woman sitting next to her chimed in.

"Romania criminal," she said.

California, on the other hand, is a much better place, Dochia said. It's kind and welcoming, she said. And safe.

"This city is good," Dochia said. "Good people in California."

And many in California want to help. But they are having trouble getting through not only a language barrier, but also the cultural barrier of a people who tend to keep to themselves.

It has been tough getting to know the Roma, say the locals, even those who say they still want to help.

"This is what we know is right in our hearts," said lifelong resident Rosemary Capanna.

A helping hand

When Capanna's grandparents came here from Italy, they were not welcomed at first. Many immigrants - Italian, eastern European - lived on the outskirts of town and were considered to be outsiders, she said.

But as the generations grew up together, they gradually accepted one another, becoming neighbors and friends. And Capanna's grandparents would likely be proud to know that she is now the town's Democratic candidate for mayor.

"They weren't refugees, but they faced something similar," Capanna said of her grandparents. "Assimilation does not happen overnight."

This week, she and attorney Lisa Buday, who spoke at a recent borough council meeting to ask her neighbors to be supportive of the Roma, agreed to talk about what has been going on in their town.

"I don't agree with lawlessness; however, we don't know who they are," Buday said about the Roma. The people of California need to start building relationships with the Roma, and learn more about them in order to create that bond of community, she said. That's what will help the community overcome the problems it's facing.

Buday thinks that many of those problems referred to by Tucker Carlson have been exaggerated.

An incident in which a chicken was killed happened early on and can be attributed to cultural differences, she said. And the public defecation? She said she understands that was a one-time thing, adding that it was simply a case involving a little boy who couldn't make it home in time.

She has had no problems with the Roma. Buday says "hello" when she sees them on the street, and she allows the children to come into her law firm's lobby to play with Oliver, the office cat.

"They're a community of people and we're trying to figure out how best to get to know them," Buday said.

She and Capanna are not sure why there has been such a public outcry against the Roma. They speculate that it's because the Roma are so visible, spending most evenings sitting on their porches.

"Maybe we should all sit on our porches and hang out," Buday said. "What they do is not all that removed from what our immigrant families did 50 years ago."

"From my perspective, people fear what they don't understand," Capanna said. "I don't know if it's fear or a lack of understanding."

Capanna loves her town and knows its residents can come around to accept their new neighbors.

It's also a town the Roma say they love. Dochia said she hopes she is granted asylum so her family can stay here, where she says the people have been kind.

"No problem with the American people," she said, motioning toward the yard where her children played. "Everything OK. See? Kids playing."

The problem, others in town say, is that the Roma have not returned the favor.

'Pure havoc'

Pam Duricic is another lifelong California resident, and earlier this month, she was a vocal part of the group that showed up at a borough council meeting. They had questions, and they wanted to report the problems they have seen.

Her neighbor, Teresa Dearinger, agreed, saying one day in May, the college students left for the summer, and all of a sudden, the Roma showed up.

"It was a shock to our community," Dearinger said.

The women say California is a quaint, family-oriented place. Dearinger moved here to raise her three children in this environment.

"We have always been a welcoming, open community," Duricic said. "We have a small university, a lot of diversity. The crime rate is next to nothing, normally. We never had any problems. Until now."

Since she spoke out at the borough council meeting, Duricic said she and her neighbors have been unfairly portrayed as closed minded and racist. That is not the case, she said, and the race of the Roma is not the issue at all.

"It's people who are not following our laws and rules," Dearinger said.

She and Duricic talked of cars speeding through the streets, traffic accidents, shoplifting attempts at Dollar General, trash strewn about yards. Some incidents they say they witnessed themselves; some they heard about from neighbors and friends.

Based on that, they believe the problems are greater than an isolated incident or two of a chicken being beheaded.

Rebecca Daniels' son took a video of some Roma slaughtering a chicken and a turkey in the Roma's yard.

And the defecation? That was more than just one child, Duricic added.

"These were not children. They were grown men, dropping their pants," she said.

Daniels said her son's car was also damaged by a Roma neighbor who sped backwards into it. The insurance company told her the car was rental from Florida - one that had been missing for solong the rental company stopped paying the insurance on it, she said.

There were numerous thefts, they say, including Dearinger's children's toys being stolen from her porch.

As the group was advised to do at the council meeting, they have been calling the police and documenting what they see, including an incident Tuesday night.

Duricic and Dearinger said a group of Roma men in an apartment building near their homes had been drinking all day. They got loud and boisterous and the children threw empty beer bottles into the street to watch them roll downhill.

When an argument broke out, one of the men struck one of the women, they say. Dearinger said she has since been subpoenaed by police to testify about this.

Police Chief Richard Encapera is the only officer authorized to speak to the media, and he was on vacation this week. Borough administrator Richard Martin would not talk to PennLive. Borough council president Patsy Alfano and Mayor Walter Weld Jr. did not return phone calls for comment.

That's part of the problem, from Duricic's perspective. She said she is getting few answers from her town officials, many of whom are lifelong friends. Even after the meeting, she walked away with just as many unanswered questions. How long will the Roma be here? Will the children go to school in California? Will they face the same penalties for breaking the law as the residents? Is ICE monitoring them?

She and some friends have tried to reach out to the Roma, saying hello, trying to start conversations. But the Roma don't respond and don't seem to want that, she said.

And in the meantime, among the locals, lifelong friendships have crumbled. She said there are people she has known her entire life who no longer speak to her. She receives nasty comments on Facebook.

"We all grew up in school together, attended town functions together, but now you are seeing that divide," she said. "Our small town that we all loved for years and chose to stay here and raise our children is no longer. It all went up in smoke."

A few blocks away, sitting on her porch with the other Roma women, Dochia said she was unaware of such problems in this town that has treated her so well.

When asked about the butchering of chickens, she explained the Roma are Muslim and chicken is a significant part of their diet since they do not eat pork. It was an isolated incident, she said.

That's where PennLive's conversation with Dochia was cut short by a dark-haired man with a heavy five o'clock shadow and a blue polo shirt.

"Our religion, no talk to women," the man said, walking up to the porch, cigarette in hand.

When asked if there was someone else who could talk, he said, walking away, "Come tomorrow. Guy come for you."

He and several other men said the same thing the day before. "Come tomorrow."

An attempt to speak to another group of Roma at a home next to California's only gas station ended similarly.

Using the Google Translate app, this PennLive reporter tried to speak to several men sitting around a table, smoking cigarettes and drinking Mountain Dew. At the sight of the phone, a balding, older man dressed in white held up his hand and said "No pictures."

When he saw the translation and realized it was a request for an interview, he simply said, "Come tomorrow."

Some California residents say the self-imposed isolation of the Romas is the root of the problems. Others say it's simply a hurdle to overcome.

But mayoral candidate Rosemary Capanna said since folks in town heard about her efforts to reach out to this community, she has been getting private messages from some of the older residents.

"They remember this happening to them," Capanna said. She hopes an understanding can be reached soon for the sake of the town they all love. "In the end, we all live together here."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Richland County Sheriff's Department says three teens have been arrested in a crime spree that was escalating from a delivery robbery to armed robberies to a near sexual assault. And the victims were targeted because of their race, according to Sheriff Leon Lott.

"This was a crime spree. They would not have stopped," Lott said. "They made a statement that they did not like white people and they were only going to rob white people."

Lott says the two suspects, 17-year-old Raquan Green and a 15-year-old whose name has not been released, were arrested Wednesday. The third suspect, a 15-year-old boy, was taken into custody at his home on Walcott Street. Lott says the trio used racism to pick their victims.

The third suspect resisted arrest and injured an RSCD investigator in the process. The investigator had to be hospitalized with a leg injury and is expected to be OK. The suspect is now being charged with assault on a police officer while resisting arrest. Sheriff Lott says that should the investigator require surgery or an extensive hospital stay, charges may be upgraded.

"Between July 3 and July 26 there have been seven separate incidents of armed robberies, some to include carjacking and kidnapping along the Bluff /Shop Road Corridor," Lott said. "Investigators discovered that the suspects began targeting delivery drivers by committing armed robberies. The crimes then escalated to carjacking and kidnapping victims."

The crime spree started on July 3 when a food delivery driver was robbed. Two more incidents of food delivery robberies happened on July 15 and July 17. On July 19, a food delivery driver was robbed and forced to drive to an ATM and withdraw money.

All the incidents happened late at night where delivery drivers were targeted and students were moving into student housing or leaving apartments in the area. The suspects stole cash, cell phones, and various electronics.

07/25 -2:00 a.m. the victim was robbed, carjacked and kidnapped at Stadium Suites (Involved third suspect)

7/26 -1:15 a.m. the victim was robbed and kidnapped at 1050 Southern Drive, (Village at Columbia Apartments) (Involved the third suspect)

Lott says one of the victims, who was African American, was released from the suspects when they found out she was not white.

Green appeared in court and was given $40,000 bond. He is still housed at the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center as of Thursday evening.

Jordan, the only victim who spoke at the press conference, said she was returning home to her apartment at The Village Apartments on Southern Drive from work on July 26 around 12:15 a.m. when a group of three black males pushed her to the ground and placed a gun to her head.

The report says the men threatened to kill her unless she drove them to a nearby ATM. She complied, the report said, and withdrew $300 from her account.

It was at that point, according to the incident report, one of the men told the victim she was going to be used for sex at his "auntie's" house, but the victim found a way to escape by jumping out of her moving vehicle on Blair Road.

Deputies responded to the scene and located the victim's empty car. The K9 unit was brought out to search for the suspects, but they were not found.

Another similar incident happened at Stadium Suites where a 20-year-old victim said he and his roommate were returning home one night this past weekend when they were approached by three males with guns. The two were then driven to an ATM at gunpoint and asked to provide $500. The victim says the suspects were only able to obtain $600 before abandoning the two in a nearby parking lot.

A different student who lives at Oaks 21 Apartments, said she believes she came close to something similar when a stranger attempted to open her car door while she was sitting inside.

A statement released via a spokesperson from Stadium Suites' parent company, JMG Realty, says are extremely concerned about these recent crimes.

"We are cooperating fully with authorities, and have informed our residents via email and through our resident portal, of the recent crimes that have been reported to us," the statement said. "We will continue to keep our residents informed as we learn of developments or warnings from the local authorities. The safety and welfare of our residents are our top priority."

The University of South Carolina has released a statement, saying:

FOUNTAIN — Water providers and residents south of Colorado Springs chafed as the U.S. Air Force on Tuesday unveiled a nine-month study verifying that firefighting foam used at Peterson Air Force Base contaminated water and soil with toxic perfluorinated chemicals at levels more than 1,000 times higher than a national health advisory limit.

Air Force officials pledged to conduct further investigations that, sometime after 2019, may include analysis of human health risks. This initial investigation focused on contamination at the base. The spread of contaminants to where tens of thousands of people live remains a mystery, the officials said.

Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment leaders have said the state was waiting on the Air Force for information on how far and how fast PFCs have moved. El Paso County and CDPHE officials at a public meeting here Tuesday night said their agencies lack money to track the PFCs moving in groundwater at unknown concentrations south toward Pueblo.

“It makes me really angry that it has taken them this long to get some numbers — and more than a little concerned,” said Fountain City Council member Greg Lauer, who has been fielding calls from anxious residents for a year. “We and our ratepayers are going to be dealing for a very long time with this problem we did not create.”

Security Water and Sanitation District manager Roy Heald said his agency spent $3.6 million on pipelines and purchases of alternative clean water supplies after municipal wells were contaminated but has yet to receive a promised $800,000 in reimbursements from the Air Force.

“Our need is immediate. It is financial. And we need to get back to being able to use our well water,” Heald said.

“PFCs are found widely in the environment today, and there are likely other contributors to the contamination,” the report summary says. “As we continue our work with the public water suppliers in the Fountain, Widefield and Security area, we will study remediation steps, as other potential contributors are investigated.”

Air Force engineers in October began investigating to determine sources of the PFCs that state and local water tests had shown to be spreading from the base, including an area where firefighters trained. PFCs have been linked to health harm — low birth weights and kidney and testicular cancers — but public health epidemiological work in Colorado has not been done. A senior Pentagon official announced that the Air Force would spend $2 billion on PFC cleanups nationwide.

The EPA in May 2016 set a health advisory limit for two types of PFCs at 70 ppt based on the latest scientific studies of what could be harmful to people and the planet.

Air Force engineers investigating at Peterson found that PFCs from firefighting foam also had contaminated irrigation ponds at a golf course at high levels. “A complete human exposure pathway exists for golfers and golf course maintenance personnel exposed to surface water,” the report says.

The U.S. government does not regulate PFCs, which also are used to make products such as stain-proof carpet, nonstick cookware and grease-resistant fast-food wrappers.

Air Force Civil Engineering Center team leader Cornell Long said military funding for environment work on this problem is secure for now. An expanded site investigation to be completed next year may include data about concentrations of PFCs beyond the base. Long also said the Air Force will honor its commitments to reimburse communities south of Colorado Springs with a total of $4.3 million.

“This is an Air Force-wide issue. As good stewards of the environment, and wanting to do the right thing for communities, it is important that we continue to work at this,” he said. “There is still more work to be done.”

The contamination levels documents in Colorado “are very similar” to levels found at other air bases around the nation and abroad, he said. “What makes it difficult here is the wide range of contamination we are seeing on the base — and the information we do not have on how the contamination might move.”

A CDPHE website shows the contaminants have spread south beyond Widefield, Security and Fountain through the Fountain Creek watershed. In April 2016, groundwater samples taken south of Fountain along Hanover Road showed PFC contamination higher than 100 ppt.

State tests for PFCs in drinking water have not been done since November, CDPHE records show. And the CDPHE hasn’t measured PFCs in groundwater since February, the records show.

On Tuesday, Tyson Ingels, CDPHE’s lead drinking-water engineer, said agency officials “are not doing any tests now. We don’t have the funds to pay for any testing.”

El Paso County health spokeswoman Danielle Oller said the county also lacks funding to track PFC contamination, but that private well owners wanting tests will be referred to the Air Force for possible help.

“They need to be testing the water,” local farmer Susan Gordon said, adding that a filter provided by the Air Force may be losing its effectiveness.

Gordon and scores of other residents of Fountain, Security and Widefield have turned to buying bottled water.

“It is a major frustration,” said Deborah Stout-Meininger, 63, a resident of Fountain for 20 years, who supplements her Social Security income with work at a truck stop but finds the $40 a month extra she pays for water a burden.

“And I get really paranoid now,” she said. “I worry about whether the I am drinking safe water or not.”

Dentures left at scene lead to Tennessee man's rape conviction 16 years later

A 67-year-old man who previously served prison time in the murder of a 6-year-old child, pleaded guilty to a 2001 rape after investigators linked him to the scene of that crime through a pair of dentures he left behind.

The dentures were part of a sex assault kit backlog that wasn't tested until recently, though authorities may have been able to identify Thomas Maupin sooner -- his name was printed on the inside of the false teeth.

Maupin was sentenced to eight years in prison for raping the 31-year-old woman in Memphis in August 2001, FOX 13 Memphis reported.

At the time, police said the victim was approached by a motorist who got out of his car and started walking to her. A pair of dentures recovered at the scene were collected and tagged by investigators as part of the sexual assault kit.

The kit was later placed in the police property room, but became part of a backlog that was not tested until July 2016, WREG reported.

Officials from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation were able to eventually match the dentures to a partial DNA profile of Maupin -- and also discovered his name printed inside.

The dentures were originally made while Maupin served time in Washington state for the 1988 murder of a 6-year-old girl. He was twice convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison, but the convictions were overturned on appeal.

The US embassy has been told to cut its staffing levels

Russia has retaliated to new US sanctions by telling Washington to cut its diplomatic staff to 455 and barring the use of some properties.

The new US embassy staffing level would be the same as at Russia's embassy in Washington.

The Russian foreign ministry also said it was seizing holiday properties and a warehouse used by US diplomats.

The new US sanctions are over Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and alleged interference in the US election.

They come months after the Obama administration ordered the seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in response to alleged hacking of the US Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign.

In a statement on Friday, Russia's foreign ministry said: "The US is stubbornly taking one crudely anti-Russian step after another, using the utterly fictitious pretext of Russian interference in its internal affairs."

The US expulsion of Russian diplomats "clearly violates the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations and generally accepted diplomatic norms", it added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A TEXAS teen who ran into a church half-naked saying she was raped was indicted for what turned out to be an elaborate hoax.

Breana Harmon, 19, was charged on Wednesday with two counts of tampering with physical evidence and two counts of tampering with a government record, which are felonies, according to the Herald Democrat.

Officials said that teen, who also uses the last name Talbott, made a false report to police on March 8 claiming to have been abducted and gang-raped behind a church in Denison, Texas.

The teen turned up at the local church covered in blood and wearing only a shirt, bra and underwear. She allegedly told parishioners that black men had taken her into the woods and raped her.

Harmon, then 18, told police that she was raped by two black men in ski masks while a third pinned her down. She claimed that the suspects had kidnapped her near her car in an apartment parking lot, news station KXII reported.

Police discovered her car with a door open and her phone, keys and shoe scattered on the ground.

Harmon was brought to a nearby hospital for examination, where physicians determined she had not suffered any injuries consistent with her claims, according to police.

Authorities searched for further evidence, but were not able to corroborate Harmon’s story. Police also said the crime scene was “staged” and Harmon’s injuries were “self-inflicted.”

When investigators confronted Harmon, she admitted that the allegations were false. It is not known what prompted her to report the hoax.

She was arrested in March for the misdemeanour offence of false report to a police officer, but officials decided to seek more charges.

“The more we have looked at what happened in this case, and considered the harm it caused, and certainly could have caused, we believe what she did fits the elements of these higher charges,” Grayson County District Attorney Joe Brown said in a statement.

“What she did was very serious, and we believe it was felony conduct.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Weather Forecast

Woman who threatened to 'kill all of ya' Somali Americans will be fired

FARGO — A white woman from Mapleton, N.D., who was recorded Tuesday, July 25, threatening a group of three Muslim women in the Walmart parking lot on 13th Avenue South, telling them to "go home" and that she would kill them, will lose her job.

“Whenever she gets here, she will be let go.” said a person at Fargo accounting firm Horab and Wentz, who would only identify himself as one of the firm's partners on Wednesday, July 26.

The man said of Amber Elizabeth Hensley: “Her views are not ours." A couple phones could be heard ringing in the background.

She was in the car with her sister, Leyla Hassan, 20, and their friend, 23-year-old Rowda Soyan. All three women live in Fargo and are originally from Somalia. They were shopping at Walmart Tuesday afternoon before going to the movie theater when they parked next to the woman.

Hensley, whose Twitter account expresses support for President Trump, commented on Facebook about the video, identifying herself and apologizing to the women.

"It was not a Christian like thing to do AT ALL and wish I could take it back, but I lost my cool and I can't. I am terribly sorry," Hensley wrote in her post. "I just wish that the whole video could be shown. And the things that were stated before she starts taping. She had parked way too close to my car and I couldn't get in, when I asked her to move she refused, I asked her again and she swore at me calling me a fat b-tch."

"But there are absolutely no excuses. I am in tears with regret and will take any form of punishment deemed fit."

Sarah Hassan said she started recording when she realized they needed evidence of the woman's "unacceptable" behavior. They called police around 5:30 p.m. and showed officers the video and the woman's license plate number as they filed a report.

Officers did not return phone calls Tuesday evening.

The women shared their concerns and the video with Hukun Dabar, executive director of Afro American Development Association, a Moorhead nonprofit. Dabar then shared the video on Facebook

Within two hours of posting the video Tuesday night, it was shared more than 530 times.

"What makes me sad is you don't see any leaders from Fargo confronting this issue and saying it's not acceptable in our community," he said. "They need to speak about this issue and have it be at the forefront."

Fargo-Moorhead is supposed to be a "welcoming city," Dabar said, but "when they don't talk about this issue it shows something else."

Dabar also called out the inaction of bystanders at Walmart who didn't defend the women or say anything to Hensley. He tied this incident to a recent case of discrimination in Moorhead.

A Somali-American man was assaulted while moving into an apartment on July 2 by two white men from the area who said, "What are these n---- doing here?" at the time of the attack, according to eyewitnesses.

Police arrested the men, James Patrick Billiot and Justin William Rifanburg, who were charged with simple assault, a misdemeanor. CAIR, a Muslim civil rights group in Minnesota, urged state and federal law enforcement officials to investigate what they called a "possible hate crime."

"It's happening again," Dabar said in reference to the two instances of discrimination in the community.

Police are urging anyone who saw the girls around the time of the attacks to come forward

A girl of 15 was raped at a train station in Birmingham before being sexually assaulted by the driver of a car she flagged down to help her.

Detectives called the two attacks at Witton station "horrifying" and said they were launching a major manhunt.

The teenager was with a friend when she was approached by a man who led her to a secluded part of the station and raped her.

Shortly after she flagged down a passing car and was assaulted again.

British Transport Police and West Midlands Police are treating it as two separate reports of rape.

The first attacker is described by police as an Asian man in his early 20s with light skin, brown eyes, skinny build and about 6ft tall.

Police said the second man was also Asian and in his early 20s and about 5ft 6in to 5ft 7in tall. He was of a large build, with a beard and wore a blue jumper and black jeans.

The attacks happened between 19:00 BST on Tuesday and 02:00 on Wednesday.

CCTV has been seized and is being investigated.

'Awful incidents'

Det Ch Insp Tony Fitzpatrick said: "This was a horrifying ordeal for this young girl and we have specially trained officers supporting her.

"It is now vitally important we investigate exactly what happened on Wednesday morning as well as identifying offenders for both of these awful incidents.

"I would be keen to speak with anyone who may have been in the area at the time. If you were passing by the station and saw two girls walking with an older man, then please get in touch immediately.

"Likewise, if you saw any suspicious vehicles close to Witton station close to 2am then please get in touch as soon as possible. Your information could prove vital in our enquiries to identify the perpetrators."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Jarvis' wife, Petra, was a new patient of Graham and had an appointment on Wednesday, officials said. The doctor at the appointment informed Jarvis and his wife that, even though she suffered from pain, he would not prescribe the opioid.

"He did what we ask our doctors to do," St. Joseph County Prosecutor Ken Cotter said at a news conference. "Don't over-prescribe opioids."

Dr. Todd Graham

Graham had declined to prescribe Petra Jarvis the medication during a 10:45 a.m. appointment Wednesday. At around 1 p.m., Michael Jarvis returned to the medical complex off of Elm Road near Mishawaka, without his wife or her knowledge, and ambushed Graham, a physician with South Bend Orthopedics, police said.

After a brief argument in the parking lot, Michael Jarvis told two witnesses to leave the scene before shooting Graham twice in the head.

Jarvis then drove away in a red Dodge Neon to a friend's home at the corner of Dragoon Trail and Valley Trail, about three miles away, and "gave them indication that he was not going to be around," Cotter said.

The friend called police, who shortly later found Jarvis dead outside the home from two self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

Cotter said Michael Jarvis was not a patient of Graham's.

"Make no mistake, this is a person who made a choice to kill Dr. Graham," Cotter said. "This is not a fallout from the opioid epidemic or any opioid problems. That probably leads us into an examination of what is happening with the opioid problem in our community, and frankly, our whole nation."

Metro Homicide Commander Tim Corbett said people inside the buildings at the medical complex were fortunate.

"If Jarvis would have gotten inside that building, although there would have been a specific target, it's like trapping an animal in a corner, they're going to come out fighting, and I truly believe this could have escalated into a mass shooting," Corbett said.

Cotter said he's received calls from doctors since the tragedy and he is trying to start a dialogue with the medical community about how to prevent such incidents in the future.

"This is a clear indication that it's not just a doctor issue, it's not just a law enforcement issue, it's our whole community's issue," Cotter said.

The red Neon was still parked in the driveway of Michael Jarvis' friend's home Thursday. A Notre Dame staff parking tag hung from the rearview mirror, and the backseat contained a cooler with "JARVIS" written on it.

University spokesman Paul Brown said in a statement, "Notre Dame has an employee on its books identified as Michael Jarvis as an on-call, part-time parking attendant and groundskeeper."

The statement also said that Graham "served as a consulting physician at Notre Dame. His brutal death is shocking to us all, we extend our condolences to his family and friends. Our prayers are with them."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        LOS ANGELES -- USC football coach Clay Helton said former Heisman Trophy-winning running back O.J. Simpson would not be welcome on campus after he is released from prison in October.

"Right now with USC, what the administration and the athletic department have said is, no, O.J. will not be a part of our functions," Helton said when asked whether Simpson would be welcome to attend a practice. "That's been the statement."

Simpson was granted parole last week in Nevada after more than eight years in prison there since being convicted in 2008 of an armed robbery involving two sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel room. The 70-year-old Simpson could be out of prison as early as Oct. 1 after serving the minimum nine years of a 33-year sentence.

Despite the university distancing itself from Simpson after he was found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman in a highly publicized trial in 1995, Simpson's No. 32 jersey is still retired and prominently displayed at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during USC home games, and a copy of the Heisman Trophy that Simpson won in 1968 is still displayed on campus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Trump ban on transgender service members alarms some military officers

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's sudden decision to ban transgender personnel from serving in the military has alarmed some senior military officers who were caught off guard by it.

Trump's declaration, which came via early morning tweets on Wednesday, appeared to pre-empt an ongoing Pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military, and he drew criticism from three senior officers interviewed by Reuters on Thursday.

"I hope our commander in chief understands that we don't transmit orders via Twitter, and that he can't, either," one said by telephone, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

"Even if this were an order, implementing it legally would take considerable time, if it's even possible."

Rights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused Trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active-duty service members and reservists, who say they number in the thousands..

The United States' top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, told the armed forces on Thursday there had been no change yet to Pentagon policy on transgender personnel.

Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged the uncertainty that followed Trump's announcement in a note to service chiefs, commanders and senior enlisted leaders.

"I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement on the transgender policy by the President," Dunford wrote.

"There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance," Dunford said in the message, first reported by Reuters.

Dunford then made the assurance that the military would "treat all of our personnel with respect."

His message neither voiced support nor opposition to Trump's decision.

One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force acknowledged that Trump's announcement on Wednesday was "unexpected."

The Defense Department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year. But Mattis on June 30 approved a six-month delay to allow for a review.

As a presidential candidate, Trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.

His move on Wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow Republicans.

The White House said Trump had "extensive discussions with his national security team," and that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president decided on Tuesday to go ahead.

Trump cited "tremendous medical costs and disruption" as a justification for the ban, a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individual's capabilities, not gender identity or sexual preference.

The Army's chief of staff, General Mark Milley, said on Thursday that there had been issues with transgender individuals serving in the Army.

"I will be candid. ... This is a complex issue and there (are) a variety of challenges out there that we have to deal with and we have been working through it, but this is not clean-cut either way," he said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said implementation of Trump's decision was still being worked out.

Separately, the Trump administration on Thursday told a U.S. appeals court in New York that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position Democratic former President Barack Obama took.

Trump's plan to ban transgender military service members has unleashed legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue.

Trump's tweets did not make clear when a ban would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join.

But if the Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight, legal experts say.

"There's no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military," said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal.

It was also unclear whether it might go beyond active-duty forces and apply to reservists.

'Breaks Your Spirit'

Indiana National Guard reservist Cameron St. Andrew, who resigned from full-time service after the November election, told Reuters that as a transgender person he was concerned about his status.

"I try to be tough about it," he said, but added: "It breaks your spirit down."

One active-duty U.S. military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said senior officials were not consulted.

"We're scratching our heads and asking where the hell this came from," the officer said by phone.

"Maybe the president is in step with some members of Congress and some voters, but he is out of step with today’s military. Our service personnel today don’t give a damn about the personal lives of their comrades so long as they know they can trust them when it counts."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    NASA scientists will chase solar eclipse in jets

Scientists will follow the shadow of the moon in two retrofitted WB-57F jet planes

For armchair astronomers and nearly everyone else watching the skies during the total solar eclipse Aug. 21, it will all be over in 2½ minutes.

But a team of NASA-funded scientists chasing the moon's shadow in retrofitted WB-57F jet planes will experience the rare phenomenon for more than seven extraordinary minutes.

A team led by Amir Caspi of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., will follow the darkness of the eclipse across the United States in two of NASA's research jets. The planes will take off from Houston and cross over Missouri, Illinois and Tennessee.

Mounted on the noses of both planes will be telescopes aimed to capture the clearest images taken to date of the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona.

"These could well turn out to be the best ever observations of high frequency phenomena in the corona," Dan Seaton, co-investigator of the project and researcher at the University of Colorado in Boulder, said in a written statement.

"Extending the observing time and going to very high altitude might allow us to see a few events or track waves that would be essentially invisible in just two minutes of observations from the ground."

Rare opportunity

During a total solar eclipse, the moon completely blocks the sun, allowing the sun's corona to be seen in stark contrast to the surrounding darkness.

Scientists hope to untangle some of the mystery around why the outer layers of the sun's atmosphere are actually hotter than the layers closer to the sun.

Micro explosions on the sun's surface — known as nanoflares — could play a part in this puzzling phenomenon, and the eclipse offers a rare opportunity to observe them.

At the same time, the team expects to get thermal images of Mercury to find out how temperatures vary across the surface of the planet closest to the sun.

NASA is funding 11 projects that will allow scientists to use the eclipse to learn about the sun and its relationship to the Earth's upper atmosphere.

It is a command that led the leading atheist Richard Dawkins to claim that the God of the Old Testament was “a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser … a genocidal … megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully”.

For God had ordered the Israelites to slaughter the apparently sinful Canaanites, saying: “You shall not leave alive anything that breathes. But you shall utterly destroy them.” And, according to the Bible, they did just that.

However, a new genetic study has found that the Canaanites actually managed to survive this purge of their traditional homeland, passing on their DNA over the centuries to their numerous descendants in modern-day Lebanon.

“The Bible reports the destruction of the Canaanite cities and the annihilation of its people; if true, the Canaanites could not have directly contributed genetically to present-day populations,” the researchers wrote.

“However, no archaeological evidence has so far been found to support widespread destruction of Canaanite cities between the Bronze and Iron Ages: cities on the Levant coast such as Sidon and Tyre show continuity of occupation until the present day.

“We show that present-day Lebanese derive most of their ancestry from a Canaanite-related population, which therefore implies substantial genetic continuity in the Levant since at least the Bronze Age.”

The degree of genetic closeness between the ancient Canaanites and modern Lebanese people was something of a surprise as the area was repeatedly fought over and conquered by various different groups throughout history, although some of them did leave genetic traces that survive to this day.

One of the researchers, Dr Marc Haber, of The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said: "The present-day Lebanese are likely to be direct descendants of the Canaanites, but they have in addition a small proportion of Eurasian ancestry that may have arrived via conquests by distant populations such as the Assyrians, Persians, or Macedonians.”

He added that it had been a “pleasant surprise” to be able to extract and analyse DNA from human remains that were nearly 4,000 years old, particularly as they were found in a hot environment.

The Canaanites are roundly condemned in the Old Testament – they were the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, two cities destroyed with fire and brimstone directly by God, according to the Book of Genesis.

While the Bible says they were wiped out by the Israelites under Joshua in the land of Canaan, later passages suggest there were at least a few survivors. Some Biblical scholars have argued the passages are hyperbole, but the genetic research would appear to indicate the slaughter was much less extensive than described.

Also known as the Phoenicians, the Canaanites proved to be great seafaring traders and established colonies across the Mediterranean.

They are also credited with inventing the first alphabet, although ironically few written records have survived the passage of time, so accounts describing them largely come from enemies and rivals, such as the Israelites, Egyptians and Greeks.

The researchers said they hoped genetic techniques could help shed more light on the region’s history.

Dr Claude Doumet-Serhal, a co-author of the paper and director of the Sidon excavation site in Lebanon, said: “For the first time we have genetic evidence for substantial continuity in the region, from the Bronze Age Canaanite population through to the present day.

“These results agree with the continuity seen by archaeologists. Collaborations between archaeologists and geneticists greatly enrich both fields of study and can answer questions about ancestry in ways that experts in neither field can answer alone.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mom reveals she used breast milk in school bake sale brownies

A mother recently posted anonymously to a parenting group on Facebook to reveal she had used her breast milk in a batch of bake sale brownies at her children’s school, and that some moms weren’t thrilled about it.

“I didn’t have time to run to the store and didn’t think it was a big deal (some of those kids could use the nutrition let’s be honest). And it wasn’t even that much,” the mother wrote. “One of the other moms found out and are blowing it way out of proportion. Idk what to do! Any suggestions?”

The comments under the post ranged from anger, to admiration, to absolute hilarity.

Some accused her of putting their children’s health at risk, saying it was comparable to exposing them to any other bodily fluids, while others downplayed the incident with sarcastic quips.

The US Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines for using other people’s breast milk to feed your baby explicitly advises not to use unscreened breast milk obtained through strangers or the internet, Fox News reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Louis Tramunti’s Wife Thought He Was Having a Heart Attack. So Why Did the Police Break His Back?

He made it unscathed from Whitestone to Westchester. Then his wife called 911 and things fell apart, fast.

07.27.17 1:00 AM ET

When Louis Tramunti’s wife called 911, she wanted EMTs to save her husband’s life after a heart attack. Instead, two policemen threw him to the floor and broke his back. It was just one of those things; didn’t even make the papers.

Louis, an old friend of an old friend of mine, called me nearly a year later because “people need to know about this, bro,” which didn’t thrill his attorney.

“I’m not typically a PR lawyer,” said Steven Falkoff when I called. “It’s a basic fact pattern and excessive-force case. I don’t know how much sexiness there is for a broader story.”

To Louis—a good-natured if foul-mouthed 37-year-old Bernie-supporting son of Whitestone, a corner of Queens untouched by gentrification or even integration—it’s the only story.

He’s been married for seven years to Szilvia, a lovely Hungarian immigrant whose calmness evens out his off-the-walls hyperactivity, and he’s worked for more than 15 years as a plumbing surveyor, making good union wages mapping out where the sleeves go as new high-end Manhattan buildings rise up. Wherever Louis works now, he etches the name of their 2-year-old son, Marco, behind where the wall will be on each floor. The job puts him on top of half-finished buildings, Manhattan stretched out before him. Being up there, he says, is what made him fear thunder.

The family lives 40 miles and a world from Henry Hill or Archie Bunker’s Queens, in a split-level house in leafy Yorktown Heights, Westchester, just past the Donald J. Trump State Park (yes, no kidding; Trump donated the land in 2006) and down the road from the Elks Lodge. Before that, they lived for eight years in an apartment a few miles away in Hartsdale.

That’s where they were on April Fool’s Day 2016, a Saturday, as Szilvia drove her car into Greenburgh to have an officer do a safety check on the child seat, since Marco—a big kid, like his dad—had to start facing front. Went to dinner with them, put Marco to sleep, and went to bed herself.

Early Sunday morning, in the midst of a huge storm, the police came to them.

The thunder woke up Szilvia, and she heard a weird, loud groan and turned to shush Louis, who she figured was once again being some sort of goofy. She sees that he’s on his stomach shaking, sweating up a storm and drooling all over himself, not responding to her and still making the weird groan. So she called 911 (“for the first time in my life,” she later told The Daily Beast. “I’m a shy person”) and told the operator her husband’s having a heart attack.

She’s still on the line when the EMTs arrived, standing at the open front door of their apartment with Marco in her arms and a drop of blood on her shirt from a stress-induced nosebleed. The first responders saw her and then Louis, all 6 feet and 200 pounds of him, lurching in his underwear and walk away, telling the Greenburgh Police Officers en route to step on it.

Two officers get there and see Louis standing against a wall, eyes open but not responding to them. They approach, shine a light in his eyes, and just as he comes to and realizes they’re there, “I’m landing on my back and hitting my head at the same time.

“They had my arms pinned and their knees to my chest and they’re still shining the light in my eyes, and I’m just coming to and then they turn me around and squeeze my elbows together behind my back, and one of them has a knee in my back, and my legs go numb. I tell them I can’t breathe but the knee’s still there. I hear something crack and they crisscross my hands and cuff them and pull me up by the back and my chest starts killing me.

“They’re not saying anything to me, just dragging me out the door and Marco’s on the couch watching and someone’s saying to my wife ‘Don’t sugarcoat it, honey, we know he beat you up.’ And then I’m outside, in my fucking underwear, in the fucking snow, before all my neighbors.”

“Now, they’re talking to me: ‘We know you beat your wife.’”

“And I’m thinking: ‘Are you fucking kidding me’?”

The EMTs get outside and an officer comes with them and cuffs Louis inside the ambulance.

“This cop is telling me: ‘Yeah you beat your wife up. Is that the kind of man you are?’’

“I’m crying. I mean, I’ve never laid a hand on my wife. I had a great day. We had dinner and I played Call of Duty and fell asleep on the couch. Went into our bed and held my wife and fell back asleep. Wake up and there are the police taking me down—boom!—and telling me I beat my wife.

“I’m licking my lips and someone tells me to fucking stop so I do and I feel nauseous. Then tells me not to throw up, or it’s going to a big problem. They put a bag over my mouth.

“I’m crying. Is this who I am? Last thing I knew, I was falling asleep.

“I remember one of them saying we have a possible fifty-fifty-one or whatever and it seemed so odd. Later I realized that meant they were reporting they had a crazy or deranged person.

“So we get to the White Plains Hospital and I’m cuffed to the gurney, screaming the whole time that my ribs are killing me and that I can’t breathe. The cop from my house is there, trying to play the good-guy role and telling me, ‘Honestly, you know you really did beat up your wife tonight. You beat your wife good.’

“This doctor comes in and asks me questions and hears the way I’m staggering in my speech and right away wants to see if I had a seizure.

“Later, they put all the wiring in my head, and they told me I’d had a seizure. My first one. In fact, I had all the signs of one, bro, that the EMTs should have recognized. My wife didn’t say that when she called 911, because she’s not a doctor.

“Then they found I had four fractured vertebrae. I was in so much pain from my back and then on so much pain medication that I didn’t realize, and the doctors didn’t find until days later, that I’d also torn the tendon between my chest and my ribs.

That was long after “the cop, the same one who kept telling me I’d beaten my wife, finally took the cuffs off me.

“He said, ‘Sorry buddy. You’ll be OK.’ And then he left.”

No charges were filed.

Here’s how the night’s events come out in the colder, more cautious language of official reports. Remember everything that follows (and is sic’d throughout) is in response to Szilvia’s call to 911 saying her husband was having a heart attack:

Narrative: U/A find Pt on scene inside residence Awake and alert but non verbal standing up against the living room. Pt not responding to verbal stimuli or commands. Pt sweating, appears frightened and acting bizarre. Listed officer and Officer Maiden placed pt in restraints for pt’s safety and others on the scene. After pt was placed in cuffs he began responded to Officers. Pt reports he does not remeber getting out of bed and that the last thing he remembers wass going to sleep and then being in hand cuffs with Officers. Pt denies pain or discomfort. Pt placed on stretcher and into ambulance… Further als assessment waived in favor of patient being transported to the appropriate facility for a psych evaluation. While enroute the pt made statements like, “is this real”, as if parnoid.Pt care tansferred to stall.

Wife on scene reports her husband awoke from bed after a loud ligthing strike sound was heard outside during a storm. Pt would not listen to her and was roaming around the apartment as if he was terrified. Wife reports pt has never acted like this before and that he does not abuse drugs or alcohol. Wife reports pt was acting normal before going to bed the evening and that everything was normal.

From the police Incident/Investigation Report, about responding to “a possible ‘heart attack’”:

On approach to the residence, the Undersigned and PO Freeman observed a Greenville Fire Captain run out of the premise and state, “He is acting up in there, you better get in fast!”

On entering, the officers observed a middle aged man wearing only his boxers standing in the landing of the kitchen… (and) a white female and a young child standing in the livingroom. Both the child and the female appeared to be afraid. It should also be noted that the female was bleeding from the nose and had blood on her shirt and there were some blood droplets on the floor.

At this point, PO Freeman attempted to make vocal contact with the unknown male (later identified: as (PT) Tramunti, Louis) with negative result. The male only stared blankly at officers while sweating profusely and looking back and forth in an agitated state and obviously acting bizarre. At this time, PO Freeman and the undersigned, for the safety of the officers and all other people on the scene, decided to achieve control of the non-vocal and non-compliant PT by placing him in handcuffs and then placing him on the floor so that he could be properly assessed by PO Paramedic Freeman… The undersigned restrained PT’s legs in order to protect himself and officer freeman from being kicked during the assessment.

And from the supplemental report filed months later by the same officer, claiming that Louis “was awake and alert, sweating and appeared frightened” when the officers entered, It stresses that Szilvia and Marco, too, “appeared frightened” and that there was blood on her shirt and “droplets” on the floor:

Despite reporting that Louis was “awake and alert,” it continues: PT did not reply to verbal communication… was acting bizarre and appeared agitated. (PT stared blankly, back and forth at Officers as if confused. While on the floor in a supine position listed Officer assessed the (PT)’s vital signs… and obvious signs of trauma, which all appeared normal.

…

“When in the back of the ambulance (PT) came out of his trance like state and began asking what happened. … (PT) stated, “is this real” numerous times as if paranoid. (PT) kept asking what had happened after being told numerous times by listed Offiicer. (PT) did not complain of injury or pain other than discomfort from the hand cuffs that remained on him during the transport to the hospital.

Louis—who spent six weeks recovering before going back to work—and Szilvia are suing after rejecting a settlement offer.

Asked about the suit, Greenburgh Police Chief Chris McNerney emailed: “We are committed to vigorously defending yet another frivolous lawsuit against a police department. We are looking forward to the facts being presented in a court of law, as there is not one credible piece of evidence to support this outrageous claim.”

Also looking forward to an accounting and a judgment is Louis, who’s still fuming 15 months later about falling asleep with his family and waking up with his back broken, being told he’d beat his wife.

“On a work site,” he says, if a storm is coming and the winds get above 25 miles per hour, you get everyone off the roof to keep them safe and, in the process, ensure your own bottom line. How is it that cops,” he asks, “are held to such a lower bar?”

He’s furious that the department’s new body-camera program hadn’t rolled out when the police showed up at his door. About how, if he loses the suit, he may have to pay the department’s legal fees. “They have the nerve to do this. That’s intimidation. That’s bullshit.”

And he’s worried about his sex life—“I’m an Italian guy from Queens who was in a body cast. It is what it is, and it isn’t good”—while Szilvia’s worried about his health and earnings to support Marco and, she hopes, his future siblings.

The legal issue here is a much narrower one, says Falkoff, Louis’ lawyer, “focused on the amount of force they used in arresting him and the perceptions of the officers as it’s unfolding. This wasn’t 20 minutes but 15 or 20 seconds. EMS tells the cops to get in there fast, because they see the wife bleeding and Louis out of it. Cops get there and maybe it’s reasonable to take Louis down to the floor when he doesn’t respond. It’s the amount of force they used to take him down that’s the issue here.”

For Louis, it comes down to right and wrong.

“I never, ever beat anybody up, been drunk in public, had any issue with the police, done anything. I live for my son and my wife, my family, and I work hard. I don’t expect this to happen to me or anybody for that matter.

“How is it that no one can say, ‘We’re sorry and that was wrong’?”

“It’s insane. I have to see doctors and a physical therapist and also someone for PTSD now. I’m back at work, but I can’t talk about it with anyone there. There’s no support group for this. And when I tell my black friend, he just says ‘that’s how it is.’

“That’s not right. That’s not how it should be. I’m trying to tell white people: They’re coming for you, too, bro.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    World news in pictures

Video footage showed the tank accelerate to meet the car as it raced towards the checkpoint.

The tank retreated as civilians ran for cover, at which point the car exploded and nearby civilians were caught in the blast.

An army spokesman said the attack could have killed 50-60 people had it reached its target.

“The explosion was large, carrying about 100kg of high explosives,” the statement said.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

An insurgency in Egypt's Sinai region has gained pace since the army toppled President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's oldest Islamist movement, following mass protests against his rule in mid-2013.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A 50-year-old German man has been killed and six people injured in a knife attack in a Hamburg supermarket, German police say.

Police said the suspect was 26 years old and born in the United Arab Emirates. They said he acted alone and he was overpowered by passersby.

It was too soon to pinpoint a motive, they tweeted.

There are unconfirmed reports that he shouted "Allahu akhbar", Arabic for "God is great" while attacking people.

Police said they were still seeking to confirm his current nationality.

The man attacked customers in the supermarket at random, ran outside and was chased by customers and by people outside the shop. They brought him to the ground before he was detained by plain-clothes police officers.

A 50-year-old woman and four men aged between 19 and 64 were stabbed, while a 35-year-old man was injured while helping overcome the suspect.

The attack happened in the Barmbek region in the north of the city in a branch of Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket chain.

Police say the man's weapon may have looked like a machete but they are, for now, assuming it was a kitchen knife.

One eyewitness made a gesture about 50cm (20 in) long when asked on German TV how big the knife was.

Asked whether this was a terror attack, a police official told the BBC: "We are at an early stage of the investigation... At the moment we can't rule anything out. We are investigating all avenues."

Speculation in German media said the attack may have been part of a robbery attempt but police said that that motive could not be confirmed.

One eyewitness, who ran from the scene into a nearby shop as the situation unfolded, told German broadcaster NTV that it seemed "hectic and confused, not like a properly planned attack".

The newspaper reported that the child and her mother are also set to be prosecuted under the Child Marriages Restraint Act, which sets the minimum marriageable age of a female at 16.

The charity Girls not Brides believes that 21 per cent of Pakistani women are married by the age of 18, often with little say in the matter.

The Pakistani National Assembly rejected a proposal to raise the minimum marriageable age for females to 18, in line with that for males.

In a recent series of widely criticised rulings, the Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional body which gives Islamic legal advice to the Pakistani Government, declared that laws prohibiting child marriage are un-Islamic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    If approved, the rate increase would be phased in over two years. The first increase would occur in the summer of 2018 and the full rate would go into affect in early 2019. I&M says a residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month would see an increase of less than $1 per day.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration the average Indiana household averaged 964 kilowatt hours per month in 2015.

“I&M’s plan prepares the company for a future of energy generation that is more diverse and will allow us to offer our customers new, cleaner energy options. The plan will improve customers’ service through investments in infrastructure that will reduce outages and directly limit service interruptions caused by severe weather,” said Toby Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer of I&M. “We intend to better serve our communities by renovating aging equipment, modernizing the delivery system with new technology and improving the reliability of service while being mindful of the cost impacts on our customers.”

The Building the Future program would also allow the utility to create a systematic, four-year tree trimming program. I&M says the number one source of customer outages is trees and other vegetation.

If approved, the rate increase would give I&M an additional $263 million a year in revenue.

I&M asked for a rate increase in 2011 but was only awarded about half of its proposal by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

Also, I&M wants to increase the minimum customer charge, also called a fixed charge. That increase would go from $7.30 to $18. The minimum charge increase would be on top of the base rate increase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    www.journalgazette.net

Shepherd's House on Tennessee Avenue near Spy Run apparently will lose federal funding used to offer transitional housing to homeless military veterans.

Shepherd's House grant denied

VA mute as to reason; director of homeless vets center stunned

BRIAN FRANCISCO | The Journal Gazette

Shepherd's House, a Fort Wayne faith-based organization that provides transitional housing�for homeless military veterans, might launch a community fund drive, curtail�its services or close its doors because of the pending loss of federal funds.

Shepherd's House co-founder Barb Cox said Thursday that the Department of Veterans Affairs apparently has denied its application for a grant worth about $496,000 a year. A similar grant has�accounted for the bulk�of the organization's $622,000 yearly budget, with the rest coming from private sources.

“We're just completely thrown for a loop, honestly,” Cox said in a telephone interview.

“We've given everything for this ministry for the last�20 years, and we've seen miracle after miracle. ... I can't even let my mind ponder God not moving and making this possible again,” she said.

Shepherd's House has�40 beds for VA-qualified homeless veterans at its Tennessee Avenue building�near Spy Run. It has been receiving grant money since 2009 through VA's�Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program, called GPD for short. The grant amounts to $46 a day for each veteran served.

VA announced�in December that it would terminate�GPD�grants dating back to 1994 and�require recipients to reapply for funding by April 4.�VA said in its termination notice that it would turn the GPD into a competitive, performance-based yearly grant program.�Existing grants expire Sept.�30, and funds�will run out Dec.�31.

“We were told clearly�that 97 percent of all the existing programs would be funded, and we knew we couldn't fall in that (remaining) 3 percent because we're not just a cot and a meal, we've got a huge clinical treatment program here,” Cox said about Shepherd's House.

She said judges from a half-dozen court systems “will only refer here, because this program is so good. I never expected not to be funded.”

Cox said she�has never received written�notice from VA that the Shepherd's House grant application had been�rejected. She said she called a VA employee�in Tampa, Florida, to ask about the application and was told, “Oh, it's not good.”

VA officials in Washington, D.C., had not responded to requests for comment by Thursday night.

Liberty Landing, a transitional housing complex for homeless veterans on South Calhoun Street, received word that�its GPD application�had been approved, according to its owner, faith-based�Volunteers of America of Indiana. Mike Lloyd, vice president of operations for the Indianapolis-based Volunteers,�said�he did not know how much VA money the�40-bed facility would receive.

Asked about the future of Shepherd's House without federal funds, Cox said�one prospect is “really, really scaling back”�medical, psychological and other services for homeless veterans.�Another option is asking for�financial contributions from Fort Wayne�organizations, foundations and residents.

“I'm praying that the community steps up�and somehow makes this go on,” she said.

Asked whether�closing is an option, Cox said: “Well, we're 30,000 square feet. You can't make an operation this big continue without funding. So I don't want to say those words out loud, but I mean, it's just obvious.”

Rep. Jim Banks, R-3rd, wrote�a letter Wednesday to VA Secretary David Shulkin seeking details on the agency's decision to deny GPD funding to Shepherd's House. He wrote�that “to date no official explanation for this decision has been provided.”

Banks, a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, noted in his letter that Cox and her husband, Shepherd's House co-founder Lonnie Cox, received�Indiana's highest civilian honor, the Sagamore of the Wabash, from�then-Gov. Mike Pence, now the nation's vice president, in 2016.

While applauding VA efforts to improve its services for homeless veterans, Banks added,�“In the wake of these changes, organizations are running out of time to navigate a course for the future.” He wrote�that Indianapolis-based Hoosier Veteran Assistance Foundation did not get an official explanation for a reduction in its�GPD funding.

Banks is�not the only member of Congress�trying to get answers. The Journal Times of Racine County, Wisconsin, reported last week that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis.,�have�written to�Shulkin�to ask why their state's veterans affairs agency�has lost a $500,000 federal VA grant for aiding homeless veterans.

VA said last year on its website that the GPD has supported more than 600 homeless veterans projects and 13,800 beds nationwide. The program served roughly 44,700 homeless veterans in fiscal 2016, with more than 16,500 of them finding permanent housing, according to the website.

The�VA notice to terminate grants stated that�the agency “expects to fund 24 existing service centers and 12,000 beds” under its new plan, in which grants would fit�five housing models. Shepherd's House had applied under the clinical and hospital-to-housing models, while Liberty Landing applied under bridge housing for short stays and service-intensive transitioning.�

The December VA notice stated�that “the�allocation of these grants needs to be�updated to reflect the documented�current need as well as to increase the�flexibility to adapt to future needs.”

The nation's homeless veteran population declined�by nearly 50�percent�between�2010�and 2016, when it was about 39,400,�according to federal estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    LARGO — Police say the father whose 8-month-old was left in a bedroom with no air conditioning was told the day before the infant's death to keep his children in another room.

William Francis Hendrickson, 25, now faces several charges after police found his son lifeless in a playpen on Thursday.

The bedroom at the S Belcher Road mobile home was 109 degrees when police arrived. The baby's body temperature was 105.6 degrees and Hendrickson's daughter, 2, was immediately sent to Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital for dehydration, according to a police affidavit.

Police said they performed CPR on the boy until paramedics arrived. The infant could not be resuscitated and died at the scene.

Meanwhile, the children's mother sat in a jail cell, arrested days earlier on a battery charge.

About 12:30 p.m. on Thursday, Largo police officers responded to assist Pinellas County Child Protection investigators with a welfare check on the two children at the King's Manor Estates mobile home park at 1399 S Belcher Rd. lot 112.

Child services had told the father the day before not to leave the children in the bedroom, police said, but Hendrickson said he had "no where else to go" after his girlfriend was arrested the week before on charges she fought with his mother.

"He kept the children confined in the bedroom with him to avoid his live-in parents," police wrote.

On Saturday, the children's mother, Elizabeth Michelle Rutenbeck, 24, was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of battery. According to an arrest report, Rutenbeck tried to force her way into Hendrickson's mother's bedroom in the mobile home.

"The defendant then pushed through the victim to get an Xbox from inside the victim's room," the report says.

Rutenbeck was booked into the Pinellas County jail. Already on probation for felony charges of grand theft, she is being held without bail.

Two days later, Hendrickson's mother, Carrie Hendrickson, filed a domestic violence petition against Rutenbeck. She identified Rutenbeck as her son's "baby mama." In it, Carrie Hendrickson wrote that Rutenbeck injured her neck and knee and that a door she damaged needs to be replaced.

"All her belongings need to be removed from premises," she wrote.

On Friday at 10 a.m., detectives knocked on the mobile home's door. The woman who answered barked, "My grandson is dead because you did not do your job," before allowing them inside.

Hendrickson faces charges of aggravated child neglect for the condition of his daughter and aggravated manslaughter in the death of his son, according to police. He has had no arrests prior to Thursday in Florida, records show.

Police said citizens need to be reminded of the dangers of Florida's scorching temperatures, particularly in confined or poorly ventilated spaces and "especially for children, the elderly, and those with special medical concerns."

Hendrickson was booked into Pinellas County Jail on Thursday night and is being held on $150,000 bail.

Mike Bobbitt has lived one lot down from the Hendrickson's cream colored and red-trimmed home for 15 years.

He would have turned 1 next week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “The State is ordered to comply with the DEA’s administrative subpoena within 21 days of issuance of this Order or face contempt sanctions upon motion made by the DEA,” U.S. District Court Judge David Nuffer wrote in the order.

North Korea has fired an an intercontinental ballistic missile which may have landed in Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), according to the country's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

The zone reaches 200 nautical miles from the country's coast. Mr Abe has called an emergency meeting of the National Security Council.

"I have received information that North Korea once again conducted a missile firing," Mr Abe said. "We will immediately analyze information and do our utmost to protect the safety of the Japanese people."

He called on the US, South Korea, Russia and China to increase pressure on the secretive state over its missile launches, which have defied international rulings.

Trump on North Korea: There are consequences for their bad behaviour

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan "absolutely cannot tolerate" repeated provocations from North Korea, also known as the DPRK.

Soon after reports of the launch emerged from Japan, the Pentagon and South Korean military officials confirmed they detected a ballistic missile launch from North Korea.

On Friday evening, Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said: "The US Department of Defence detected and tracked a single North Korea missile launch today. We assess that this missile was an intercontinental ballistic missile, as had been expected.

"The missile was launched from Mupyong-ni and travelled about 1,000km before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. We are working with our interagency partners on a more detailed assessment.

"The North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.

"Our commitment to the defence of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad. We are prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation."

Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis said the lengthy flight time meant the missile was likely a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), potentially capable of travelling 10,000km and hitting a target in the US.

According to Yonhap news agency, South Korean military officials said the missile was launched from Jagang Province, in the north of the DPRK.

South Korea has also called a national security meeting.

The night time launch of the ICBM was unusual, as most take place around dawn. Dr. John Nilsson-Wright, senior research fellow on Chatham House's Asia programme, told The Independent this could have been to demonstrate the military was capable of launching in varying conditions.

Alternatively, Dr Nilsson-Wright said, "maybe the element of surprise is part of the reason why they wanted to do this".

He added: "I think they've shown that they have the capability, the increased technical sophistication, and I think there will be a lot of anxiety in Seoul and Tokyo."

It comes just one day after the 64th anniversary of the end of the Korean War -- known as Victory Day in the North.

International tensions have been mounting over the nuclear ambitions of North Korea in recent months, and Donald Trump has threatened to "take care" of the unstable situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Just over two years after candidate Donald Trump mocked John McCain's Vietnam War record, noting that he prefers heroes "who weren't captured", the Arizona senator stuck a dagger in President Trump's healthcare reform plans.

There were gasps when Mr McCain, after being furiously lobbied by Vice-President Mike Pence, joined two other Republican senators in voting against the so-called "skinny" repeal plan, considered the bare minimum Senate Republicans could agree on.

Instead of a big step toward becoming law - either in its skinny form or after further negotiations with the House of Representatives - the future of Obamacare repeal has been thrown into doubt.

The reality is, for now, there is no minimum level of change on which Senate Republicans can agree. They either have to work with Democrats or resign themselves to stalemate and move on to other topics, like taxes or infrastructure spending.

It will take some time for the scale of this late-night Senate drama to sink in. No one really expected Mr McCain to be the decisive vote, but the man who once had a reputation as a Republican "maverick", now facing a dire brain cancer diagnosis, had at least one more surprise in his pocket.

What was the 'skinny repeal'?

The bill - officially known as the Health Care Freedom Act - would have eliminated parts of Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act - including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage or pay a fine, and the employer mandate, which requires the same of companies with 50 employees or more.

It also would have temporarily repealed a tax on medical devices, defund the US women's group Planned Parenthood for a year and provide more money to community health centres, as well as given states more flexibility in complying with Obamacare regulations.

But the pared-down measure would have left much of Obamacare untouched, including the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for the poor that faced deep cuts in earlier proposals.

A requirement that all insurance plans cover essential health benefits, federal subsidies to help consumers pay for insurance as well as taxes on wealthy Americans also would have remained in place.

The stripped down bill came after earlier Senate defeats for proposals to replace Obamacare and then to partially repeal it.

Sen McCain said he had voted against the skinny repeal because it did not amount to meaningful reform and would not have improved care for Americans.

He added that House Speaker Paul Ryan's assurance that the House would be willing to send the bill for further consideration by committee "did not ease my concern that this shell of a bill could be taken up and passed at any time".

What now for Obamacare?

There are not thought to be any further plans for a new bill to repeal Obamacare because the skinny repeal was seen as the only measure Republicans could get through Congress.

However, lawmakers could revive the issue and take it up later in the year.

Following the vote, President Trump tweeted: "As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal."

Mr Trump's position on healthcare reform has varied - he has spoken out at various points for Obamacare being repealed, repealed and replaced, or being allowed to collapse by itself.

In his statement, Mr McCain said Obamacare was in a state of "collapse", with healthcare premiums "skyrocketing" and providers "fleeing the marketplace".

He criticised the way Obamacare had been passed by Democrats using their Obama-era majority and called for senators to "return to the correct way of legislating" with input from both parties.

"We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) project called “Imperial” included three hacking tools for infiltrating the Mac and Linux operating systems, according to the latest “Vault 7” leaks.

Cyber security in the Middle East

It is not just western countries such as the US and the UK that are being targeted by hackers, as the rapidly developed and wealthy nations of the Middle East become targets of both politically and financially driven attacks. Discover how cyber security expertise can help businesses in the Middle East navigate digital transformations and keep cyber criminals at bay.

WikiLeaks claims that a source provided portions of an archive of the CIA’s hacking arsenal, including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponised “zero day” exploits and malware remote control systems that was circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorised manner.

The latest documents to be leaked detail hacking tools called Achilles, Aeris and SeaPea.

According to the documents, Achilles is aimed at enabling CIA agents to “trojan an [Mac] OS X disk image (.dmg) installer with one or more desired operator specified executables for a one-time execution”.

SeaPea is designed to function as a Mac OS X rootkit for versions 10.6 and 10.7 to allow CIA agents to infiltrate a system while it reboots to carry out monitoring operations and launch tools.

SeaPea’s manual was previously released by WikiLeaks in another Vault 7 release named DarkSeaSkies, which detailed hacking tools targeting Macs and iPhones.

Aeris is described as an automated implant written in the C programming language that targets Linux distributions, including Debian, Red Hat, Solaris, FreeBSD and CentOS.

The documents claim Aeris is designed to function as a backdoor to these Linux distributions and can be used to build customised implants tailored for specific operations.

There is a lot of “fog” surrounding cyber weapons and cyber war because there is no way of knowing the true capability of any country, says security expert Mikko Hypponen.

Aeris supports “automated file exfiltration, configurable beacon interval and jitter, standalone and Collide-based HTTPS LP support and SMTP protocol support – all with TLS encrypted communications with mutual authentication”, according to WikiLeaks.

WikiLeaks says the documents indicate the scope of the CIA’s global covert hacking programme, its malware arsenal and dozens of “zero day” weaponised exploits against a wide range of US and European company products.

WikiLeaks claims that since 2001, the CIA has gained political and budgetary pre-eminence over the US National Security Agency (NSA) and built its own group of hackers.

By the end of 2016, says WikiLeaks, the CIA’s hacking division had more than 5,000 registered users and had produced more than 1,000 hacking systems, trojans, viruses and other “weaponised” malware, creating, in effect, its “own NSA” but with “even less accountability”.

WikiLeaks said the source of the Vault 7 leaks suggested there were policy questions that urgently needed to be debated in public, including whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.

“The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons,” said WikiLeaks.

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo and Co said it would reimburse about $80 million to 570,000 customers who may have been charged wrongly due to issues related to auto collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies.

Wells Fargo has been engulfed in scandal since September, when it reached a $190 million settlement with regulators over complaints that its retail banking staff had opened as many as 2.1 million unauthorized client accounts.

The bank had fired 5,300 employees for improper sales tactics over five years, but did not make much changes to policies and procedures, or hold managers accountable until there was a public outcry.

Wells Fargo said late Thursday it would pay back $80 million to customers wrongly charged for car loan insurance in the coming months, which included $64 million in cash and $16 million of account adjustments.

"We take full responsibility for our failure to appropriately manage the CPI program and are extremely sorry for any harm this caused our customers," said Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo Consumer Lending.

The bank said it had started a review of the CPI program in July 2016 and discontinued the program in September, based on the findings.

New York Times reported earlier that more than 800,000 people who took car loans from Wells Fargo were charged for auto insurance they did not need, and some of the customers were still paying for it. nyti.ms/2tIdyUE

About 490,000 customers had duplicate vehicle insurance coverage and about 60,000 customers did not receive complete disclosures from vendors, prior to CPI coverage, Wells Fargo said.

For about 20,000 customers, additional costs of the CPI could have led to defaults resulting in seizure of their vehicles. The bank said these customers would receive additional payments as compensation for the loss of their vehicles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will explore cutting the level of nicotine in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels, a radical step that would reshape the $130 billion American tobacco industry and potentially encourage millions of people to quit smoking.

The move, announced Friday, would represent one of the most sweeping federal efforts to reduce smoking since Congress required cigarette packages to carry health warnings in 1965. It follows other moves by President Donald Trump’s FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to try and deal with the high cost of prescription drugs and opioid addiction, two issues not directly within the agency’s traditional mandate.

Tobacco stocks plunged after the announcement, which came just hours after the failure of Republicans’ effort to repeal and replace much of the Affordable Care Act. The FDA’s move is likely to set off a lobbying fight in Washington, even as it pushes the industry to move faster in the development of new products that rely less on burning tobacco and more on potentially lower-risk technologies like vaping.

“The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes -- the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users,” Gottlieb said in a statement announcing the move. “Unless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.”

Gottlieb also said regulators will look at banning menthol and flavored-products because of their potential for attracting young people. An administration official said the White House supports the move, and disagreed that it was a break from Trump’s anti-regulation agenda.

Tobacco Innovation

In a briefing Friday, he called nicotine both the “problem” and “ultimately, the solution.” Along with nicotine reduction, the FDA plans to ease the path of entry for less-harmful nicotine delivery systems. The FDA “must also recognize potential for innovation to lead to less harmful products,” Gottlieb said in the briefing.

“I’ve pledged a deep commitment to taking aggressive steps to address the epidemic of addiction to opioids,” Gottlieb said. “I view our opportunity to confront addiction to nicotine with the same obligation. I’ll pursue efforts to reduce addiction to nicotine with the same vigor.”

While reducing nicotine is bad news for the cigarette business, the impact could be tempered for companies like Philip Morris International Inc. and Altria Group Inc., which have been putting more emphasis on innovations they say have less health risks. Philip Morris has spent over $3 billion on developing its reduced-risk portfolio.

“This was a big surprise and will make it imperative that domestic tobacco companies strive to develop innovative, safer products,” said Jack Russo, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. who follows the tobacco industry.

Shares of Altria dropped as much as 19 percent, the biggest intraday decline since 1999. British American Tobacco’s stock fell as much as 14 percent.

“Until the eventual development of specific proposals, it’s too early to understand the practical implications,” said Simon Evans, a spokesman for Imperial Brands Plc, a Bristol, U.K.-based tobacco manufacturer that sells Winston and Kool cigarettes. Shares of the company fell as much as 9.5 percent.

Unexpected

The move caught some in Washington by surprise. Representative Robert Aderholt, the Alabama Republican who runs the congressional subcommittee overseeing the FDA budget, said Gottlieb called earlier in the day to give him a heads up on the new policy.

“I’m still trying to get my arms around it,” said Aderholt.

The Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-smoking advocacy group that’s been active in past tobacco regulatory changes, said it didn’t get a preview of the announcement. Staff were gathered in a conference room watching Gottlieb’s announcement when they got the news, Becky Wexler, a spokeswoman, said via email.

FDA Authority

The FDA gained oversight of tobacco products in 2009 through the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The law said that agency had “the authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other harmful components of tobacco products.”

Developing regulations around the proposal will take time, and is likely to create fierce debate.

“The FDA plans to begin a public dialogue about lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to nonaddictive levels through achievable product standards,” the agency said in the announcement.

Representatives of Philip Morris and Altria didn’t respond to requests for comment. British American Tobacco’s Reynolds American division said it was encouraged by the move and that the FDA had recognized “tobacco harm reduction policies and the continuum of risk for tobacco products.”

Sales of cigarettes have already been in decline, hurt in part by rising taxes. The industry’s cigarette sales volume dropped an estimated 4.5 percent last quarter, Altria reported earlier this week. The average state excise tax was $1.74 per pack last quarter, compared with 19 cents for the same time last year, according to Altria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A congressional information technology staffer was arrested Monday evening before a scheduled flight for Lahore, Pakistan, and charged with bank fraud in connection with a $165,000 loan from the congressional Federal Credit Union, authorities said.

Imran Awan, 37, pleaded not guilty Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey in Washington and was released to a high-intensity supervision program whose conditions include GPS monitoring, a nighttime curfew and staying within a 50-mile radius of his home in Lorton, federal prosecutors said. He was arrested at Dulles International Airport, his attorney said.

Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, allegedly secured a $165,000 home equity loan in January from CFCU on a house in Alexandria after claiming it was their primary residence, when it was a rental property, FBI Special Agent Brandon C. Merriman wrote in an affidavit for Awan’s arrest. The couple told the credit union to wire the money to Pakistan for use in purchasing a property, Merriman wrote.

Alvi, also a former House IT worker, and the couple’s three school-aged children, were approached by federal agents but allowed to board a flight to Lahore on March 5 Merriman wrote, but he said that he “does not believe that Alvi has any intention to return to the United States.”

Awan’s attorney, Chris Gowen, said in a statement, “Because we are confident in the integrity of the U.S. justice system, we are confident that Mr. Awan will soon be able to clear his name and get on with his life. Neither Mr. Awan nor his wife have ever had any intention to ‘flee’ the United States.”

“They are U.S. citizens who have built a full life and have a strong community life in this country. They will stand and fight whatever charges are presented,” Gowen said. The couple had round trip tickets, and Awan had informed the government of his plans to travel, Gowen said.

Awan had worked for the House since 2004 as a shared employee, getting paid about $165,000 per year from about a dozen Democratic members in 2015 and 2016, for example, according to Legistorm. Most payments ended by early February, the congressional data tracking service reported.

Awan worked most recently for U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), before he was fired Tuesday, her spokesman said.

“Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,” David Damron said.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office of the District and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Capitol Police declined to comment, citing the pending case.

Border officers appeared to encourage teen to drink from bottle containing liquid meth

A government surveillance video obtained by ABC News has shed new light on a tragic incident at the U.S.-Mexico border, sparking outrage from members of Congress who help oversee U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The video shows that in 2013 two U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers appeared to encourage, or at least permit, a 16-year-old Mexican high school student to drink from a bottle that tests would later reveal contained concentrated liquid methamphetamine.

The young man, Cruz Velazquez, died within two hours of drinking the substance, but the two officers involved, Valerie Baird and Adrian Perallon, remain on the job today, with no disciplinary action taken against them.

A former head of internal affairs at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, James Tomsheck, told ABC News the two officers violated agency protocols by allowing the young man to drink from the bottle, and that he was told at the time they would be punished.

"If they truly suspected there was a controlled substance in the bottle," Tomsheck said, "they should've conducted a field test."

Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California and the ranking member on the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, condemned the officers' conduct.

"Drug smuggling is wrong and is a crime, but this teenage boy did not deserve a death sentence," Lofgren told ABC News. "For CBP officers to inflict a summary death sentence is not only immoral, but also illegal."

Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Missouri and the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, echoed those sentiments.

"In order for CBP officers to prevent smuggling, ensure public safety, and do their difficult job at the border properly, CBP must have the appropriate protocols in place and officers must follow them," Thompson told ABC News. "While there is no excuse for attempting to bring illicit substances into the country, it is absolutely clear from the video that there were numerous failures in judgement and procedure that led to the senseless death of a 16-year-old boy. CBP must ensure that such a tragedy never occurs again."

The video, which will air for the first time today on Good Morning America, World News Tonight with David Muir, 20/20 and Nightline as part of a year-long investigation of U.S. Customs and Border Protection conducted by ABC News and The Investigative Fund, shows that Velazquez took four drinks from the bottle, and the officers appear to repeatedly encourage him with hand gestures.

The Velazquez family ultimately filed a civil lawsuit against the officers and the agency, claiming that the officers' actions led to Cruz's death.

"What you see, I think, is a basic lack of compassion and decency toward a 16-year-old boy," said Gene Iredale, the San Diego-based attorney who represented the Velazquez family. "Almost a delight that you would see in children who just pull the wings off flies slowly, a smile when he's being asked to drink something and being put in this position."

Both officers, who declined through their attorneys to be interviewed by ABC News, denied asking Velazquez to drink from the bottle, and the official report called the incident an "accident." Officer Perallon claimed Velazquez "volunteered" to take a drink.

In response to the broader ABC News investigation, which revealed a history of cases in which the agency appeared to ignore accusations of mistreatment and abuse, the agency issued a statement, saying, "CBP takes all allegations of mistreatment seriously, and does not tolerate actions that are not consistent with our core values of vigilance, service to country and integrity."

The Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego released a brief statement to ABC News.

"The Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego provided consular and legal assistance to Mr. Cruz Velazquez's family since it learned about his death. This tragic incident highlights the need of greater transparency and accountability in immigration control activities."

Earlier this year, the U.S. government paid the teen's family $1 million to settle a lawsuit. There was no apology or admission of wrongdoing, and both officers testified that they never received a reprimand for their conduct, a fact that still angers members of Velazquez's family.

"How can the government allow that? It's like, OK you can kill someone," Reyna Velazquez, Cruz's sister, told ABC News. "They took him as a fool, as who cares. Well, that fool, he was the greatest person I ever knew."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A corrections officer was placed on administrative leave after pulling a gun on an ATV rider in North Pole while he was off duty.

According to the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, GoPro video footage taken May 29 by an all-terrain vehicle rider named Devarge Walker shows him riding down a gravel road when Gregory Braeuer, an off-duty corrections officer at the Fairbanks Correctional Center, gets out of his pickup, approaches Walker and says, "This ain't a racetrack."

Braeuer reaches for the ATV, and a struggle ensues. Walker tells Braeuer to "get the f–k off my bike. The f–k's wrong with you?" Braeuer responds, "What's wrong with you?"

Then Braeuer goes back to his truck, takes out a gun and walks toward Walker.

"Get on the ground right now," Braeuer says. After that point the GoPro camera moves and is facing part of the ATV. Braeuer references his badge and repeats himself: "Get on the f–king ground." Walker gets on the ground.

An argument ensues, and Walker tells Braeuer he is being recorded. Walker's friends are also heard talking.

Braeuer "is currently on administrative leave pending further administrative hearings," Alaska Department of Corrections spokesperson Megan Edge said in an email.

She said Alaska State Troopers are investigating the incident, as well as the DOC professional conduct unit.

"Correctional officers do not have the authority to detain anyone outside of a correctional facility," Edge said in the email. "Correctional officers are also not authorized to carry firearms in the course of their duties. As a private citizen, Mr. Braeuer does have the right to carry a firearm."

The News-Miner reported that Walker was charged with fourth-degree assault on July 5, and Braeuer "has not been charged."

Charlie Gard, the baby whose fate was the subject of a protracted court battle and made headlines around the world, has died, his parents have said.

They fought a five-month campaign to have him transferred from Great Ormond Street hospital, where he was on life support for experimental treatment they hoped could give Charlie, who was blind and deaf and could not breath without a ventilator, “a meaningful life”. But they abandoned their legal battle on Monday, saying it was too late to save him. On Thursday he was transferred to an unspecified hospice and he died the next day, a week before he would have turned one, after having his life support systems withdrawn.

In a statement, Charlie’s mother, Connie Yates, said: “Our beautiful little boy has gone. We are so proud of you, Charlie.”

Prime Minister Theresa May said she was “deeply saddened” by his death and her “thoughts and prayers” were with his parents.

After his parents accepted he had no realistic prospect of improvement, blaming the deterioration in his muscles while they were battling Gosh, whose doctors believed the experimental treatment would not work and only prolong Charlie’s suffering the couple fought further battles against Gosh in increasingly acrimonious proceedings.

But in the face of opposition from Gosh, which said the invasive ventilation required by Charlie was not deliverable at home, they agreed with the hospital that he would be transferred to a hospice for his final hours.

But still the parties disagreed with the family wanting to keep him alive for several days but the hospital saying that would require a 24/7 intensive care team which was impossible to find for a hospice setting.

The judge, Mr Justice gave the parents time to find such a team but they were unsuccessful and he directed that an alternative plan should be put in place involving a much shorter time spent at the hospice on life support, the details of which were were not made public.

Hundreds of people, who called themselves Charlie’s Army, supported the campaign for him to receive treatment in the US, raising £1.35m.

A spokeswoman for Gosh said on Thursday: “The risk of an unplanned and chaotic end to Charlie’s life is an unthinkable outcome for all concerned and would rob his parents of precious last moments with him.

“As the judge has now ruled, we will arrange for Charlie to be transferred to a specialist children’s hospice, whose remarkable and compassionate staff will support his family at this impossible time.”

Charlie had a form of mitochondrial disease, a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage, although his parents claimed the hospital was wrong in saying he had already suffered severe irreversible brain damage. Yates and Gard also disputed with Gosh that their son was in pain.

Earlier this month, Pope Francis said he had been following the case closely and hoped that Charlie’s parents would be able to “accompany and treat their child until the end”. The Vatican children’s hospital also offered to take over his care from Gosh.

Shortly afterwards, Trump tweeted: “If we can help little Charlie Gard, as per our friends in the UK and the pope, we would be delighted to do so.”

Gard and Yates, both in their 30s from Bedfont, west London, went back to the high court this month after claiming they had new evidence of the prospects of the NBT therapy being successful. But at an emotional court hearing on Monday, which saw both parents in tears, as well as lawyers, members of the public and press said they were finally abandoning the case, paying tribute to Charlie as

“absolute warrior”.

In a statement, Yates read out from the witness box in the packed courtroom in central London, Yates said: “Mummy and Daddy love you so much, Charlie, we always have and we always will, and we are so sorry that we couldn’t save you. We had the chance, but we weren’t allowed to give you that chance. Sweet dreams baby. Sleep tight, our beautiful little boy.”

Yates said time had been wasted and “had Charlie been given the treatment sooner, he would have had the potential to be a normal, healthy little boy”.

But doctors at Gosh did not agree, with lawyers representing the hospital saying the “clinical picture” six months ago had shown irreversible damage to Charlie’s brain.

Over the course of the legal dispute, a worldwide campaign mobilised in support of Charlie’s parents, raising £1.3m. But some supporters made death threats, condemned by Francis and Gard and Yates, against Gosh doctors and staff. A hospital spokeswoman said on Friday: “Everyone at Great Ormond Street Hospital sends their heartfelt condolences to Charlie’s parents and loved-ones at this very sad time.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Police body cam footage of man tased in back prompts $110K settlement

However, police board said tasing was “reasonable, appropriate, and within policy.”

Body cam footage of an Aurora, Colorado, cop tasing an unarmed black man in the back paved the way for the city to pay $110,000 to settle police abuse allegations, the man's lawyers told Ars Thursday.

Footage from September's tasing shows two black men being questioned by police who are responding to a weapons incident at a nearby apartment building. One of the men is seen and overheard on the video demanding to know why he's being questioned. "For what... ?" he says.

The victim, Darsean Kelley, then appears to thump his chest with his right hand and yell, "I know my rights." He's then tased in the back, loses his faculties, and falls flat on his back. He begins screaming uncontrollably, according to the video. Adding insult to injury, he's also arrested, charged with failure to obey police, and then jailed for three days because he's unable to post bail.

Body cams and dash cams are increasingly being deployed by police in the aftermath of high-profile shootings in recent years. They're designed to record police actions to protect cops from false allegations, and they're also used for public accountability purposes. In this instance, the video prompted a legal settlement. At the same time, however, police said the video showed the officer was not out of line.

"The body camera footage was indispensable in securing justice for Darsean Kelley," John M. Krieger, a spokesman with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, told Ars. "Without irrefutable evidence of police misconduct captured on video, it would have been our client's word against multiple officers, and the truth about what happened to Darsean would almost certainly have never come to light."

The ACLU eventually convinced the authorities to drop the charges against Kelley. Its lawyers argued that their client was illegally detained when he was outside with his cousin. All the while, the Aurora Police Department has ruled the tasing as acceptable within department policy. The city said it was settling the legal claim (PDF) before a lawsuit was filed to avoid the expense of litigation.

Aurora City Attorney Mike Hyman said in a statement that the city settled so it wouldn’t have to spend even more taxpayer money defending a lawsuit.

"We disagree with the ACLU's characterization of the events in this case and their unwarranted attack against the Aurora Police Department," Hyman said Thursday. "This case was settled for the reason that many cases are settled—to avoid the cost of prolonged litigation. That cost would have far exceeded the value of the settlement."

The police department's internal review board cleared the cops of wrongdoing in October, concluding that the use of force "was reasonable, appropriate, and within policy." The officer who deployed the electronic device believed Kelley was reaching for a weapon.

When officers arrived in the area of the call they found an agitated Kelley yelling at another man and lawfully stopped him. After failing to obey numerous orders, Mr. Kelley was tased and subsequently arrested and charged in Aurora Municipal Court with ACC 94-110(5) Failure to Obey Lawful Orders.

The use of force applied against Mr. Kelley was later reviewed by the Force Review Board (FRB). The FRB is empaneled to review uses of force to determine compliance with Department Directives, procedures, and training. The FRB determined the force applied in this incident was within policy.

The ACLU said Kelley was not hospitalized. But in its claim for damages, the ACLU said that, because of the incident, Kelley has "developed a deep and lasting fear of the police."

WASHINGOTN: Two Sikh Americans have been killed in two separate incidents in one week in California, according to community organisations and media reports.

Subag Singh, 68, was found dead in a canal after he went missing in the morning of June 23. His body had injuries.

California law enforcement officials from Fresno county have said that they were trying to find out who was responsible for the killing of the elderly Sikh American.

"Deputies found his body with visible trauma in a canal on McCall and Jensen. Investigators are trying to piece together what led up to the body being found in a canal," Fox26 news said in a report.

Deputies are not saying if this was a hate crime or not, but members of the Sikh community say this would not be the first, it said.

"Honestly, we are very hurt, it just hurts us. And it just we then, think what else do we need to do," Gurdeep Shergill, a local community leader, was quoted as saying.

In a separate incident, Simranjit Singh, 20, of Elk Grove was shot dead on July 25 outside a gas station where he worked.

According to Sacramento Bee news, he was shot dead by men who had earlier assaulted his co-worker.

"At this point in both investigations, it is unclear if either of these crimes were racially motivated but we are working with both local and federal laws enforcement authorities to ensure these murders are thoroughly investigated and that the local jurisdictions are treating the cases with the utmost importance," said Sikh American Legal Defence and Education Fund (SALDEF).

"These attacks are inexcusable and we offer our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of Subag Singh and Simranjit Singh.

"We call upon local and federal law enforcement agencies to thoroughly investigate these heinous crimes and classify them as hate incidents if hate is show to be a motive," SALDEF executive director Baldev Singh said.

There have been a number of attacks targeting Indian- Americans and Sikhs in the recent months in the US.

In March, a 39-year-old Sikh man was shot in the arm outside his home in Kent, Washington, by a partially-masked gunman who shouted "go back to your own country".

In February, 32-year-old Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed when a US Navy veteran opened fire at him and his friend Alok Madasani, yelling "get out of my country"

‘It is just a beginning,’ Imran Khan, Pakistan's opposition leader and a petitioner in the high-profile Panama case, said as he hailed the Supreme Court's decision to disqualify Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Pakistan's Supreme Court disqualified 67-year-old Sharif for dishonesty and ruled that corruption cases be filed against him and his children over the Panama Papers scandal, forcing the embattled leader out of office.

Prosecutor: Martin Shkreli repeatedly lied to investors

Prosecutor: Martin Shkreli repeatedly lied to investors

NEW YORK (AP) — Wealthy investors say former biotech CEO Martin Shkreli told them he was managing tens of millions of dollars' worth of investments, that they were making double-digit returns and they could withdraw their money at any time.

Prosecutors in closing arguments Thursday at Shkreli's securities fraud trial said it was all a brazen con. The defense countered that no one should feel sorry for the alleged victims because they were high-rollers who ended up doubling or tripling their money.

Shkreli, 34, is best known for jacking up the price of a life-saving drug and trolling his critics on social media, but his trial in Brooklyn has focused on his time running a pair of hedge funds.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith told jurors Shkreli "lied to investors to get their money into the funds and then lied to them so they wouldn't take it out."

The prosecutor recounted testimony by investors who told jurors that Shkreli claimed to be managing up to $40 million in one of his firms at a time when its brokerage account held only a few hundred dollars. When one investor asked for his money back, Shkreli stalled for months until he used a Ponzi-like scheme to secretly raid a second fund to return a portion of the funds, she said.

"The defendant was lying not only about the ability to get a redemption, but also about where that money was coming from," she said.

As Shkreli was "blowing up" his hedge funds with bad stock picks, he continued to recruit new investors by portraying himself as a Wall Street whiz who graduated from Columbia University, Smith said. He really attended a lesser-known public university, Baruch College.

Claims "that he was some sort of genius in the investing industry were completely untrue," she said.

The defense has sought to portray the impish Shkreli as a misunderstood eccentric who slept on the floor of his office in a sleeping bag for two years while starting a successful drug company that allowed him to enrich his alleged victims.

"Who does that if you're committing a fraud and you have millions of dollars in people's money?" said his attorney, Ben Brafman. "He has no life. He's the hermit scientist."

Shkreli is "not a Ponzi guy who's taking money and buying a Cadillac or a yacht," the lawyer added at another point.

The lawyer agreed Shkreli could be annoying, saying, "In terms of people skills, he's impossible." But he claimed the clients who appeared as government witnesses were still eager to bet on him.

Investors "found him strange. They found him weird. And they gave him money. Why? Because they recognized genius," Brafman said.

Shkreli didn't testify, but throughout the trial he has used Facebook to bash prosecutors and news organizations covering his case, despite his lawyer's efforts to shut him up. In one recent post, he wrote, "This was a bogus case from day one."

The trial is in its fifth week. Jury deliberations could begin on Friday.

NEW YORK (AP) — Former pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli was portrayed both as a swindler by the government and as a well-meaning prodigy by his lawyers on the second day of closing arguments Friday at his securities fraud trial.

The trial in federal court in Brooklyn "has exposed Martin Shkreli for who he really is — a con man who stole millions," Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis told jurors.

Prosecutors allege that the 34-year-old Shkreli looted his drug company, Retrophin, of stock and cash so he could pay back disgruntled investors in a pair of failed hedge funds he ran. Investors testified that the defendant repeatedly lied to them about what was going on with their money.

The defense has argued that no one was victimized because Shkreli used his "genius" to make Retrophin a success and ensure investors doubled or even tripled their money.

"Who lost anything? Nobody," defense attorney Ben Brafman said in his closing argument. Some investors were forced to admit on the witness stand that partnering with Shkreli was "the greatest investment I've ever made," he added.

The lawyer also argued that a drug company official who testified for the government was biased. If Shkreli is found guilty of a felony, Brafman said, the company would have clear grounds for forcing him out as CEO in 2014 and would gain ammunition in its $65 million lawsuit against him. Shkreli claims he was wrongfully terminated and is owed millions.

With a guilty verdict, "Retrophin pops a Champagne cork," he said.

Shkreli became notorious for using another drug company to raise the price of a life-saving drug 5,000 percent and for trolling his critics on social media, where he's been dubbed "Pharma Bro."

The defendant didn't testify. But he made his thoughts on the case known on Facebook, where he called it "bogus."

The jury was expected to begin deliberating as soon as Friday afternoon.

This story has been corrected to show that the $65 million refers to damages sought in a lawsuit, not a $65 million stake in a drug company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    'People fear what they don't understand': Culture clash with immigrants divides Pa. town

CALIFORNIA, Pa. -- Almost overnight they arrived, close to 100 Romanian immigrants who are members of a minority group called Roma, to take up residence in this small town along the Monongahela River.

If you've heard of California, it's probably because of the university. That's at one end of town, with brick buildings and bright colors. The rest of the town is filled with homes and businesses that are more time-worn, many of them built to house steelworkers and coal miners before those industries evaporated. Now they are home to their children, and grandchildren.

With a population of just about 6,700, it's a place where everyone knows everyone. But the presence of the newcomers, who arrived in May, seems to be tearing apart the bonds that have been built over generations.

"This is turning lifelong friends against each other," said Rebecca Daniels, who has lived in California her entire life. "I don't know if this can be fixed."

Immigrants took up residence in vacant, off-campus student housing -- particularly one rustic-looking apartment building where this week small, dark-haired children ran and played. Men in crisp polo shirts or clean, white button downs sat around tables and talked and smoked. Women, in long dresses, some wearing traditional Muslim head dressings, did the same, huddled on a long, splintered porch, apart from the men.

Some in California, many descended from immigrants, say they want to welcome their new neighbors and help them become a part of the community.

But others say the Roma -- sometimes referred to as gypsies --are different than the Italian Americans who came to town a handful of generations ago. Neighbors say - and loudly proclaimed at a recent borough council meeting - that the Roma refuse to assimilate, or even communicate, and have been wreaking havoc since their unexpected arrival.

They tell stories of Roma butchering chickens and defecating in public. Those stories recently gained attention when they were repeated on national television by Tucker Carlson, host of Fox News show "Tucker Carlson Tonight."

It's difficult to tell how and when this group of Roma got to the United States, but officials with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement say there are 97 of them living in California.

They are here unlawfully, officials say, and are part of ICE's Alternative to Detention Program, which allows them to remain in the community as they await court hearings and final orders to stay or to be deported back to Romania.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services could not confirm that the Roma are seeking asylum since those applications are confidential, but one Roma who briefly spoke with PennLive said that is why they are here - seeking asylum from persecution in their home country, something these nomadic people have suffered across Europe for decades, even centuries.

She said her name is Dochia.

She appeared to be in her late 20s and drank Coca Cola out of a wine glass as she smoked a cigarette. She was surrounded by several older women and spoke on the condition that no photos would be taken. During the interview Wednesday evening, a half-dozen children ran around the yard, shouting and playing.

That's why she came to the United States, she said. For the children.

"In my country, no help for kids," Dochia said. "I want to make good life in America with kids."

When she mentioned her home country, an older woman sitting next to her chimed in.

"Romania criminal," she said.

California, on the other hand, is a much better place, Dochia said. It's kind and welcoming, she said. And safe.

"This city is good," Dochia said. "Good people in California."

And many in California want to help. But they are having trouble getting through not only a language barrier, but also the cultural barrier of a people who tend to keep to themselves.

It has been tough getting to know the Roma, say the locals, even those who say they still want to help.

"This is what we know is right in our hearts," said lifelong resident Rosemary Capanna.

A helping hand

When Capanna's grandparents came here from Italy, they were not welcomed at first. Many immigrants - Italian, eastern European - lived on the outskirts of town and were considered to be outsiders, she said.

But as the generations grew up together, they gradually accepted one another, becoming neighbors and friends. And Capanna's grandparents would likely be proud to know that she is now the town's Democratic candidate for mayor.

"They weren't refugees, but they faced something similar," Capanna said of her grandparents. "Assimilation does not happen overnight."

This week, she and attorney Lisa Buday, who spoke at a recent borough council meeting to ask her neighbors to be supportive of the Roma, agreed to talk about what has been going on in their town.

"I don't agree with lawlessness; however, we don't know who they are," Buday said about the Roma. The people of California need to start building relationships with the Roma, and learn more about them in order to create that bond of community, she said. That's what will help the community overcome the problems it's facing.

Buday thinks that many of those problems referred to by Tucker Carlson have been exaggerated.

An incident in which a chicken was killed happened early on and can be attributed to cultural differences, she said. And the public defecation? She said she understands that was a one-time thing, adding that it was simply a case involving a little boy who couldn't make it home in time.

She has had no problems with the Roma. Buday says "hello" when she sees them on the street, and she allows the children to come into her law firm's lobby to play with Oliver, the office cat.

"They're a community of people and we're trying to figure out how best to get to know them," Buday said.

She and Capanna are not sure why there has been such a public outcry against the Roma. They speculate that it's because the Roma are so visible, spending most evenings sitting on their porches.

"Maybe we should all sit on our porches and hang out," Buday said. "What they do is not all that removed from what our immigrant families did 50 years ago."

"From my perspective, people fear what they don't understand," Capanna said. "I don't know if it's fear or a lack of understanding."

Capanna loves her town and knows its residents can come around to accept their new neighbors.

It's also a town the Roma say they love. Dochia said she hopes she is granted asylum so her family can stay here, where she says the people have been kind.

"No problem with the American people," she said, motioning toward the yard where her children played. "Everything OK. See? Kids playing."

The problem, others in town say, is that the Roma have not returned the favor.

'Pure havoc'

Pam Duricic is another lifelong California resident, and earlier this month, she was a vocal part of the group that showed up at a borough council meeting. They had questions, and they wanted to report the problems they have seen.

Her neighbor, Teresa Dearinger, agreed, saying one day in May, the college students left for the summer, and all of a sudden, the Roma showed up.

"It was a shock to our community," Dearinger said.

The women say California is a quaint, family-oriented place. Dearinger moved here to raise her three children in this environment.

"We have always been a welcoming, open community," Duricic said. "We have a small university, a lot of diversity. The crime rate is next to nothing, normally. We never had any problems. Until now."

Since she spoke out at the borough council meeting, Duricic said she and her neighbors have been unfairly portrayed as closed minded and racist. That is not the case, she said, and the race of the Roma is not the issue at all.

"It's people who are not following our laws and rules," Dearinger said.

She and Duricic talked of cars speeding through the streets, traffic accidents, shoplifting attempts at Dollar General, trash strewn about yards. Some incidents they say they witnessed themselves; some they heard about from neighbors and friends.

Based on that, they believe the problems are greater than an isolated incident or two of a chicken being beheaded.

Rebecca Daniels' son took a video of some Roma slaughtering a chicken and a turkey in the Roma's yard.

And the defecation? That was more than just one child, Duricic added.

"These were not children. They were grown men, dropping their pants," she said.

Daniels said her son's car was also damaged by a Roma neighbor who sped backwards into it. The insurance company told her the car was rental from Florida - one that had been missing for solong the rental company stopped paying the insurance on it, she said.

There were numerous thefts, they say, including Dearinger's children's toys being stolen from her porch.

As the group was advised to do at the council meeting, they have been calling the police and documenting what they see, including an incident Tuesday night.

Duricic and Dearinger said a group of Roma men in an apartment building near their homes had been drinking all day. They got loud and boisterous and the children threw empty beer bottles into the street to watch them roll downhill.

When an argument broke out, one of the men struck one of the women, they say. Dearinger said she has since been subpoenaed by police to testify about this.

Police Chief Richard Encapera is the only officer authorized to speak to the media, and he was on vacation this week. Borough administrator Richard Martin would not talk to PennLive. Borough council president Patsy Alfano and Mayor Walter Weld Jr. did not return phone calls for comment.

That's part of the problem, from Duricic's perspective. She said she is getting few answers from her town officials, many of whom are lifelong friends. Even after the meeting, she walked away with just as many unanswered questions. How long will the Roma be here? Will the children go to school in California? Will they face the same penalties for breaking the law as the residents? Is ICE monitoring them?

She and some friends have tried to reach out to the Roma, saying hello, trying to start conversations. But the Roma don't respond and don't seem to want that, she said.

And in the meantime, among the locals, lifelong friendships have crumbled. She said there are people she has known her entire life who no longer speak to her. She receives nasty comments on Facebook.

"We all grew up in school together, attended town functions together, but now you are seeing that divide," she said. "Our small town that we all loved for years and chose to stay here and raise our children is no longer. It all went up in smoke."

A few blocks away, sitting on her porch with the other Roma women, Dochia said she was unaware of such problems in this town that has treated her so well.

When asked about the butchering of chickens, she explained the Roma are Muslim and chicken is a significant part of their diet since they do not eat pork. It was an isolated incident, she said.

That's where PennLive's conversation with Dochia was cut short by a dark-haired man with a heavy five o'clock shadow and a blue polo shirt.

"Our religion, no talk to women," the man said, walking up to the porch, cigarette in hand.

When asked if there was someone else who could talk, he said, walking away, "Come tomorrow. Guy come for you."

He and several other men said the same thing the day before. "Come tomorrow."

An attempt to speak to another group of Roma at a home next to California's only gas station ended similarly.

Using the Google Translate app, this PennLive reporter tried to speak to several men sitting around a table, smoking cigarettes and drinking Mountain Dew. At the sight of the phone, a balding, older man dressed in white held up his hand and said "No pictures."

When he saw the translation and realized it was a request for an interview, he simply said, "Come tomorrow."

Some California residents say the self-imposed isolation of the Romas is the root of the problems. Others say it's simply a hurdle to overcome.

But mayoral candidate Rosemary Capanna said since folks in town heard about her efforts to reach out to this community, she has been getting private messages from some of the older residents.

"They remember this happening to them," Capanna said. She hopes an understanding can be reached soon for the sake of the town they all love. "In the end, we all live together here."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Richland County Sheriff's Department says three teens have been arrested in a crime spree that was escalating from a delivery robbery to armed robberies to a near sexual assault. And the victims were targeted because of their race, according to Sheriff Leon Lott.

"This was a crime spree. They would not have stopped," Lott said. "They made a statement that they did not like white people and they were only going to rob white people."

Lott says the two suspects, 17-year-old Raquan Green and a 15-year-old whose name has not been released, were arrested Wednesday. The third suspect, a 15-year-old boy, was taken into custody at his home on Walcott Street. Lott says the trio used racism to pick their victims.

The third suspect resisted arrest and injured an RSCD investigator in the process. The investigator had to be hospitalized with a leg injury and is expected to be OK. The suspect is now being charged with assault on a police officer while resisting arrest. Sheriff Lott says that should the investigator require surgery or an extensive hospital stay, charges may be upgraded.

"Between July 3 and July 26 there have been seven separate incidents of armed robberies, some to include carjacking and kidnapping along the Bluff /Shop Road Corridor," Lott said. "Investigators discovered that the suspects began targeting delivery drivers by committing armed robberies. The crimes then escalated to carjacking and kidnapping victims."

The crime spree started on July 3 when a food delivery driver was robbed. Two more incidents of food delivery robberies happened on July 15 and July 17. On July 19, a food delivery driver was robbed and forced to drive to an ATM and withdraw money.

All the incidents happened late at night where delivery drivers were targeted and students were moving into student housing or leaving apartments in the area. The suspects stole cash, cell phones, and various electronics.

07/25 -2:00 a.m. the victim was robbed, carjacked and kidnapped at Stadium Suites (Involved third suspect)

7/26 -1:15 a.m. the victim was robbed and kidnapped at 1050 Southern Drive, (Village at Columbia Apartments) (Involved the third suspect)

Lott says one of the victims, who was African American, was released from the suspects when they found out she was not white.

Green appeared in court and was given $40,000 bond. He is still housed at the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center as of Thursday evening.

Jordan, the only victim who spoke at the press conference, said she was returning home to her apartment at The Village Apartments on Southern Drive from work on July 26 around 12:15 a.m. when a group of three black males pushed her to the ground and placed a gun to her head.

The report says the men threatened to kill her unless she drove them to a nearby ATM. She complied, the report said, and withdrew $300 from her account.

It was at that point, according to the incident report, one of the men told the victim she was going to be used for sex at his "auntie's" house, but the victim found a way to escape by jumping out of her moving vehicle on Blair Road.

Deputies responded to the scene and located the victim's empty car. The K9 unit was brought out to search for the suspects, but they were not found.

Another similar incident happened at Stadium Suites where a 20-year-old victim said he and his roommate were returning home one night this past weekend when they were approached by three males with guns. The two were then driven to an ATM at gunpoint and asked to provide $500. The victim says the suspects were only able to obtain $600 before abandoning the two in a nearby parking lot.

A different student who lives at Oaks 21 Apartments, said she believes she came close to something similar when a stranger attempted to open her car door while she was sitting inside.

A statement released via a spokesperson from Stadium Suites' parent company, JMG Realty, says are extremely concerned about these recent crimes.

"We are cooperating fully with authorities, and have informed our residents via email and through our resident portal, of the recent crimes that have been reported to us," the statement said. "We will continue to keep our residents informed as we learn of developments or warnings from the local authorities. The safety and welfare of our residents are our top priority."

FOUNTAIN — Water providers and residents south of Colorado Springs chafed as the U.S. Air Force on Tuesday unveiled a nine-month study verifying that firefighting foam used at Peterson Air Force Base contaminated water and soil with toxic perfluorinated chemicals at levels more than 1,000 times higher than a national health advisory limit.

Air Force officials pledged to conduct further investigations that, sometime after 2019, may include analysis of human health risks. This initial investigation focused on contamination at the base. The spread of contaminants to where tens of thousands of people live remains a mystery, the officials said.

Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment leaders have said the state was waiting on the Air Force for information on how far and how fast PFCs have moved. El Paso County and CDPHE officials at a public meeting here Tuesday night said their agencies lack money to track the PFCs moving in groundwater at unknown concentrations south toward Pueblo.

“It makes me really angry that it has taken them this long to get some numbers — and more than a little concerned,” said Fountain City Council member Greg Lauer, who has been fielding calls from anxious residents for a year. “We and our ratepayers are going to be dealing for a very long time with this problem we did not create.”

Security Water and Sanitation District manager Roy Heald said his agency spent $3.6 million on pipelines and purchases of alternative clean water supplies after municipal wells were contaminated but has yet to receive a promised $800,000 in reimbursements from the Air Force.

“Our need is immediate. It is financial. And we need to get back to being able to use our well water,” Heald said.

“PFCs are found widely in the environment today, and there are likely other contributors to the contamination,” the report summary says. “As we continue our work with the public water suppliers in the Fountain, Widefield and Security area, we will study remediation steps, as other potential contributors are investigated.”

Air Force engineers in October began investigating to determine sources of the PFCs that state and local water tests had shown to be spreading from the base, including an area where firefighters trained. PFCs have been linked to health harm — low birth weights and kidney and testicular cancers — but public health epidemiological work in Colorado has not been done. A senior Pentagon official announced that the Air Force would spend $2 billion on PFC cleanups nationwide.

The EPA in May 2016 set a health advisory limit for two types of PFCs at 70 ppt based on the latest scientific studies of what could be harmful to people and the planet.

Air Force engineers investigating at Peterson found that PFCs from firefighting foam also had contaminated irrigation ponds at a golf course at high levels. “A complete human exposure pathway exists for golfers and golf course maintenance personnel exposed to surface water,” the report says.

The U.S. government does not regulate PFCs, which also are used to make products such as stain-proof carpet, nonstick cookware and grease-resistant fast-food wrappers.

Air Force Civil Engineering Center team leader Cornell Long said military funding for environment work on this problem is secure for now. An expanded site investigation to be completed next year may include data about concentrations of PFCs beyond the base. Long also said the Air Force will honor its commitments to reimburse communities south of Colorado Springs with a total of $4.3 million.

“This is an Air Force-wide issue. As good stewards of the environment, and wanting to do the right thing for communities, it is important that we continue to work at this,” he said. “There is still more work to be done.”

The contamination levels documents in Colorado “are very similar” to levels found at other air bases around the nation and abroad, he said. “What makes it difficult here is the wide range of contamination we are seeing on the base — and the information we do not have on how the contamination might move.”

A CDPHE website shows the contaminants have spread south beyond Widefield, Security and Fountain through the Fountain Creek watershed. In April 2016, groundwater samples taken south of Fountain along Hanover Road showed PFC contamination higher than 100 ppt.

State tests for PFCs in drinking water have not been done since November, CDPHE records show. And the CDPHE hasn’t measured PFCs in groundwater since February, the records show.

On Tuesday, Tyson Ingels, CDPHE’s lead drinking-water engineer, said agency officials “are not doing any tests now. We don’t have the funds to pay for any testing.”

El Paso County health spokeswoman Danielle Oller said the county also lacks funding to track PFC contamination, but that private well owners wanting tests will be referred to the Air Force for possible help.

“They need to be testing the water,” local farmer Susan Gordon said, adding that a filter provided by the Air Force may be losing its effectiveness.

Gordon and scores of other residents of Fountain, Security and Widefield have turned to buying bottled water.

“It is a major frustration,” said Deborah Stout-Meininger, 63, a resident of Fountain for 20 years, who supplements her Social Security income with work at a truck stop but finds the $40 a month extra she pays for water a burden.

“And I get really paranoid now,” she said. “I worry about whether the I am drinking safe water or not.”

Dentures left at scene lead to Tennessee man's rape conviction 16 years later

A 67-year-old man who previously served prison time in the murder of a 6-year-old child, pleaded guilty to a 2001 rape after investigators linked him to the scene of that crime through a pair of dentures he left behind.

The dentures were part of a sex assault kit backlog that wasn't tested until recently, though authorities may have been able to identify Thomas Maupin sooner -- his name was printed on the inside of the false teeth.

Maupin was sentenced to eight years in prison for raping the 31-year-old woman in Memphis in August 2001, FOX 13 Memphis reported.

At the time, police said the victim was approached by a motorist who got out of his car and started walking to her. A pair of dentures recovered at the scene were collected and tagged by investigators as part of the sexual assault kit.

The kit was later placed in the police property room, but became part of a backlog that was not tested until July 2016, WREG reported.

Officials from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation were able to eventually match the dentures to a partial DNA profile of Maupin -- and also discovered his name printed inside.

The dentures were originally made while Maupin served time in Washington state for the 1988 murder of a 6-year-old girl. He was twice convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison, but the convictions were overturned on appeal.

The US embassy has been told to cut its staffing levels

Russia has retaliated to new US sanctions by telling Washington to cut its diplomatic staff to 455 and barring the use of some properties.

The new US embassy staffing level would be the same as at Russia's embassy in Washington.

The Russian foreign ministry also said it was seizing holiday properties and a warehouse used by US diplomats.

The new US sanctions are over Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and alleged interference in the US election.

They come months after the Obama administration ordered the seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in response to alleged hacking of the US Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign.

In a statement on Friday, Russia's foreign ministry said: "The US is stubbornly taking one crudely anti-Russian step after another, using the utterly fictitious pretext of Russian interference in its internal affairs."

The US expulsion of Russian diplomats "clearly violates the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations and generally accepted diplomatic norms", it added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A TEXAS teen who ran into a church half-naked saying she was raped was indicted for what turned out to be an elaborate hoax.

Breana Harmon, 19, was charged on Wednesday with two counts of tampering with physical evidence and two counts of tampering with a government record, which are felonies, according to the Herald Democrat.

Officials said that teen, who also uses the last name Talbott, made a false report to police on March 8 claiming to have been abducted and gang-raped behind a church in Denison, Texas.

The teen turned up at the local church covered in blood and wearing only a shirt, bra and underwear. She allegedly told parishioners that black men had taken her into the woods and raped her.

Harmon, then 18, told police that she was raped by two black men in ski masks while a third pinned her down. She claimed that the suspects had kidnapped her near her car in an apartment parking lot, news station KXII reported.

Police discovered her car with a door open and her phone, keys and shoe scattered on the ground.

Harmon was brought to a nearby hospital for examination, where physicians determined she had not suffered any injuries consistent with her claims, according to police.

Authorities searched for further evidence, but were not able to corroborate Harmon’s story. Police also said the crime scene was “staged” and Harmon’s injuries were “self-inflicted.”

Breana reported to police that she had been abducted and sexually assaulted by three individuals.Source:Supplied

When investigators confronted Harmon, she admitted that the allegations were false. It is not known what prompted her to report the hoax.

She was arrested in March for the misdemeanour offence of false report to a police officer, but officials decided to seek more charges.

“The more we have looked at what happened in this case, and considered the harm it caused, and certainly could have caused, we believe what she did fits the elements of these higher charges,” Grayson County District Attorney Joe Brown said in a statement.

“What she did was very serious, and we believe it was felony conduct.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Weather Forecast

Woman who threatened to 'kill all of ya' Somali Americans will be fired

FARGO — A white woman from Mapleton, N.D., who was recorded Tuesday, July 25, threatening a group of three Muslim women in the Walmart parking lot on 13th Avenue South, telling them to "go home" and that she would kill them, will lose her job.

“Whenever she gets here, she will be let go.” said a person at Fargo accounting firm Horab and Wentz, who would only identify himself as one of the firm's partners on Wednesday, July 26.

The man said of Amber Elizabeth Hensley: “Her views are not ours." A couple phones could be heard ringing in the background.

She was in the car with her sister, Leyla Hassan, 20, and their friend, 23-year-old Rowda Soyan. All three women live in Fargo and are originally from Somalia. They were shopping at Walmart Tuesday afternoon before going to the movie theater when they parked next to the woman.

Hensley, whose Twitter account expresses support for President Trump, commented on Facebook about the video, identifying herself and apologizing to the women.

"It was not a Christian like thing to do AT ALL and wish I could take it back, but I lost my cool and I can't. I am terribly sorry," Hensley wrote in her post. "I just wish that the whole video could be shown. And the things that were stated before she starts taping. She had parked way too close to my car and I couldn't get in, when I asked her to move she refused, I asked her again and she swore at me calling me a fat b-tch."

"But there are absolutely no excuses. I am in tears with regret and will take any form of punishment deemed fit."

Sarah Hassan said she started recording when she realized they needed evidence of the woman's "unacceptable" behavior. They called police around 5:30 p.m. and showed officers the video and the woman's license plate number as they filed a report.

Officers did not return phone calls Tuesday evening.

The women shared their concerns and the video with Hukun Dabar, executive director of Afro American Development Association, a Moorhead nonprofit. Dabar then shared the video on Facebook

Within two hours of posting the video Tuesday night, it was shared more than 530 times.

"What makes me sad is you don't see any leaders from Fargo confronting this issue and saying it's not acceptable in our community," he said. "They need to speak about this issue and have it be at the forefront."

Fargo-Moorhead is supposed to be a "welcoming city," Dabar said, but "when they don't talk about this issue it shows something else."

Dabar also called out the inaction of bystanders at Walmart who didn't defend the women or say anything to Hensley. He tied this incident to a recent case of discrimination in Moorhead.

A Somali-American man was assaulted while moving into an apartment on July 2 by two white men from the area who said, "What are these n---- doing here?" at the time of the attack, according to eyewitnesses.

Police arrested the men, James Patrick Billiot and Justin William Rifanburg, who were charged with simple assault, a misdemeanor. CAIR, a Muslim civil rights group in Minnesota, urged state and federal law enforcement officials to investigate what they called a "possible hate crime."

"It's happening again," Dabar said in reference to the two instances of discrimination in the community.

Police are urging anyone who saw the girls around the time of the attacks to come forward

A girl of 15 was raped at a train station in Birmingham before being sexually assaulted by the driver of a car she flagged down to help her.

Detectives called the two attacks at Witton station "horrifying" and said they were launching a major manhunt.

The teenager was with a friend when she was approached by a man who led her to a secluded part of the station and raped her.

Shortly after she flagged down a passing car and was assaulted again.

British Transport Police and West Midlands Police are treating it as two separate reports of rape.

The first attacker is described by police as an Asian man in his early 20s with light skin, brown eyes, skinny build and about 6ft tall.

Police said the second man was also Asian and in his early 20s and about 5ft 6in to 5ft 7in tall. He was of a large build, with a beard and wore a blue jumper and black jeans.

The attacks happened between 19:00 BST on Tuesday and 02:00 on Wednesday.

CCTV has been seized and is being investigated.

'Awful incidents'

Det Ch Insp Tony Fitzpatrick said: "This was a horrifying ordeal for this young girl and we have specially trained officers supporting her.

"It is now vitally important we investigate exactly what happened on Wednesday morning as well as identifying offenders for both of these awful incidents.

Jarvis' wife, Petra, was a new patient of Graham and had an appointment on Wednesday, officials said. The doctor at the appointment informed Jarvis and his wife that, even though she suffered from pain, he would not prescribe the opioid.

"He did what we ask our doctors to do," St. Joseph County Prosecutor Ken Cotter said at a news conference. "Don't over-prescribe opioids."

Dr. Todd Graham

Graham had declined to prescribe Petra Jarvis the medication during a 10:45 a.m. appointment Wednesday. At around 1 p.m., Michael Jarvis returned to the medical complex off of Elm Road near Mishawaka, without his wife or her knowledge, and ambushed Graham, a physician with South Bend Orthopedics, police said.

After a brief argument in the parking lot, Michael Jarvis told two witnesses to leave the scene before shooting Graham twice in the head.

Jarvis then drove away in a red Dodge Neon to a friend's home at the corner of Dragoon Trail and Valley Trail, about three miles away, and "gave them indication that he was not going to be around," Cotter said.

The friend called police, who shortly later found Jarvis dead outside the home from two self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

Cotter said Michael Jarvis was not a patient of Graham's.

"Make no mistake, this is a person who made a choice to kill Dr. Graham," Cotter said. "This is not a fallout from the opioid epidemic or any opioid problems. That probably leads us into an examination of what is happening with the opioid problem in our community, and frankly, our whole nation."

Metro Homicide Commander Tim Corbett said people inside the buildings at the medical complex were fortunate.

"If Jarvis would have gotten inside that building, although there would have been a specific target, it's like trapping an animal in a corner, they're going to come out fighting, and I truly believe this could have escalated into a mass shooting," Corbett said.

Cotter said he's received calls from doctors since the tragedy and he is trying to start a dialogue with the medical community about how to prevent such incidents in the future.

"This is a clear indication that it's not just a doctor issue, it's not just a law enforcement issue, it's our whole community's issue," Cotter said.

The red Neon was still parked in the driveway of Michael Jarvis' friend's home Thursday. A Notre Dame staff parking tag hung from the rearview mirror, and the backseat contained a cooler with "JARVIS" written on it.

University spokesman Paul Brown said in a statement, "Notre Dame has an employee on its books identified as Michael Jarvis as an on-call, part-time parking attendant and groundskeeper."

The statement also said that Graham "served as a consulting physician at Notre Dame. His brutal death is shocking to us all, we extend our condolences to his family and friends. Our prayers are with them."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    NASA scientists will chase solar eclipse in jets

Scientists will follow the shadow of the moon in two retrofitted WB-57F jet planes

For armchair astronomers and nearly everyone else watching the skies during the total solar eclipse Aug. 21, it will all be over in 2½ minutes.

But a team of NASA-funded scientists chasing the moon's shadow in retrofitted WB-57F jet planes will experience the rare phenomenon for more than seven extraordinary minutes.

A team led by Amir Caspi of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., will follow the darkness of the eclipse across the United States in two of NASA's research jets. The planes will take off from Houston and cross over Missouri, Illinois and Tennessee.

Mounted on the noses of both planes will be telescopes aimed to capture the clearest images taken to date of the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona.

"These could well turn out to be the best ever observations of high frequency phenomena in the corona," Dan Seaton, co-investigator of the project and researcher at the University of Colorado in Boulder, said in a written statement.

"Extending the observing time and going to very high altitude might allow us to see a few events or track waves that would be essentially invisible in just two minutes of observations from the ground."

Rare opportunity

During a total solar eclipse, the moon completely blocks the sun, allowing the sun's corona to be seen in stark contrast to the surrounding darkness.

Scientists hope to untangle some of the mystery around why the outer layers of the sun's atmosphere are actually hotter than the layers closer to the sun.

Micro explosions on the sun's surface — known as nanoflares — could play a part in this puzzling phenomenon, and the eclipse offers a rare opportunity to observe them.

At the same time, the team expects to get thermal images of Mercury to find out how temperatures vary across the surface of the planet closest to the sun.

NASA is funding 11 projects that will allow scientists to use the eclipse to learn about the sun and its relationship to the Earth's upper atmosphere.

LOS ANGELES -- USC football coach Clay Helton said former Heisman Trophy-winning running back O.J. Simpson would not be welcome on campus after he is released from prison in October.

"Right now with USC, what the administration and the athletic department have said is, no, O.J. will not be a part of our functions," Helton said when asked whether Simpson would be welcome to attend a practice. "That's been the statement."

Simpson was granted parole last week in Nevada after more than eight years in prison there since being convicted in 2008 of an armed robbery involving two sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel room. The 70-year-old Simpson could be out of prison as early as Oct. 1 after serving the minimum nine years of a 33-year sentence.

Despite the university distancing itself from Simpson after he was found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman in a highly publicized trial in 1995, Simpson's No. 32 jersey is still retired and prominently displayed at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during USC home games, and a copy of the Heisman Trophy that Simpson won in 1968 is still displayed on campus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Trump ban on transgender service members alarms some military officers

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's sudden decision to ban transgender personnel from serving in the military has alarmed some senior military officers who were caught off guard by it.

Trump's declaration, which came via early morning tweets on Wednesday, appeared to pre-empt an ongoing Pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military, and he drew criticism from three senior officers interviewed by Reuters on Thursday.

"I hope our commander in chief understands that we don't transmit orders via Twitter, and that he can't, either," one said by telephone, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

"Even if this were an order, implementing it legally would take considerable time, if it's even possible."

Rights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused Trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active-duty service members and reservists, who say they number in the thousands..

The United States' top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, told the armed forces on Thursday there had been no change yet to Pentagon policy on transgender personnel.

Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged the uncertainty that followed Trump's announcement in a note to service chiefs, commanders and senior enlisted leaders.

"I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement on the transgender policy by the President," Dunford wrote.

"There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance," Dunford said in the message, first reported by Reuters.

Dunford then made the assurance that the military would "treat all of our personnel with respect."

His message neither voiced support nor opposition to Trump's decision.

One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force acknowledged that Trump's announcement on Wednesday was "unexpected."

The Defense Department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year. But Mattis on June 30 approved a six-month delay to allow for a review.

As a presidential candidate, Trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.

His move on Wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow Republicans.

The White House said Trump had "extensive discussions with his national security team," and that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president decided on Tuesday to go ahead.

Trump cited "tremendous medical costs and disruption" as a justification for the ban, a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individual's capabilities, not gender identity or sexual preference.

The Army's chief of staff, General Mark Milley, said on Thursday that there had been issues with transgender individuals serving in the Army.

"I will be candid. ... This is a complex issue and there (are) a variety of challenges out there that we have to deal with and we have been working through it, but this is not clean-cut either way," he said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said implementation of Trump's decision was still being worked out.

Separately, the Trump administration on Thursday told a U.S. appeals court in New York that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position Democratic former President Barack Obama took.

Trump's plan to ban transgender military service members has unleashed legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue.

Trump's tweets did not make clear when a ban would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join.

But if the Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight, legal experts say.

"There's no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military," said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal.

It was also unclear whether it might go beyond active-duty forces and apply to reservists.

'Breaks Your Spirit'

Indiana National Guard reservist Cameron St. Andrew, who resigned from full-time service after the November election, told Reuters that as a transgender person he was concerned about his status.

"I try to be tough about it," he said, but added: "It breaks your spirit down."

One active-duty U.S. military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said senior officials were not consulted.

"We're scratching our heads and asking where the hell this came from," the officer said by phone.

"Maybe the president is in step with some members of Congress and some voters, but he is out of step with today’s military. Our service personnel today don’t give a damn about the personal lives of their comrades so long as they know they can trust them when it counts."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    It is a command that led the leading atheist Richard Dawkins to claim that the God of the Old Testament was “a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser … a genocidal … megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully”.

For God had ordered the Israelites to slaughter the apparently sinful Canaanites, saying: “You shall not leave alive anything that breathes. But you shall utterly destroy them.” And, according to the Bible, they did just that.

However, a new genetic study has found that the Canaanites actually managed to survive this purge of their traditional homeland, passing on their DNA over the centuries to their numerous descendants in modern-day Lebanon.

“The Bible reports the destruction of the Canaanite cities and the annihilation of its people; if true, the Canaanites could not have directly contributed genetically to present-day populations,” the researchers wrote.

“However, no archaeological evidence has so far been found to support widespread destruction of Canaanite cities between the Bronze and Iron Ages: cities on the Levant coast such as Sidon and Tyre show continuity of occupation until the present day.

“We show that present-day Lebanese derive most of their ancestry from a Canaanite-related population, which therefore implies substantial genetic continuity in the Levant since at least the Bronze Age.”

The degree of genetic closeness between the ancient Canaanites and modern Lebanese people was something of a surprise as the area was repeatedly fought over and conquered by various different groups throughout history, although some of them did leave genetic traces that survive to this day.

One of the researchers, Dr Marc Haber, of The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said: "The present-day Lebanese are likely to be direct descendants of the Canaanites, but they have in addition a small proportion of Eurasian ancestry that may have arrived via conquests by distant populations such as the Assyrians, Persians, or Macedonians.”

He added that it had been a “pleasant surprise” to be able to extract and analyse DNA from human remains that were nearly 4,000 years old, particularly as they were found in a hot environment.

The Canaanites are roundly condemned in the Old Testament – they were the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, two cities destroyed with fire and brimstone directly by God, according to the Book of Genesis.

While the Bible says they were wiped out by the Israelites under Joshua in the land of Canaan, later passages suggest there were at least a few survivors. Some Biblical scholars have argued the passages are hyperbole, but the genetic research would appear to indicate the slaughter was much less extensive than described.

Also known as the Phoenicians, the Canaanites proved to be great seafaring traders and established colonies across the Mediterranean.

They are also credited with inventing the first alphabet, although ironically few written records have survived the passage of time, so accounts describing them largely come from enemies and rivals, such as the Israelites, Egyptians and Greeks.

The researchers said they hoped genetic techniques could help shed more light on the region’s history.

Dr Claude Doumet-Serhal, a co-author of the paper and director of the Sidon excavation site in Lebanon, said: “For the first time we have genetic evidence for substantial continuity in the region, from the Bronze Age Canaanite population through to the present day.

“These results agree with the continuity seen by archaeologists. Collaborations between archaeologists and geneticists greatly enrich both fields of study and can answer questions about ancestry in ways that experts in neither field can answer alone.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mom reveals she used breast milk in school bake sale brownies

A mother recently posted anonymously to a parenting group on Facebook to reveal she had used her breast milk in a batch of bake sale brownies at her children’s school, and that some moms weren’t thrilled about it.

“I didn’t have time to run to the store and didn’t think it was a big deal (some of those kids could use the nutrition let’s be honest). And it wasn’t even that much,” the mother wrote. “One of the other moms found out and are blowing it way out of proportion. Idk what to do! Any suggestions?”

The comments under the post ranged from anger, to admiration, to absolute hilarity.

Some accused her of putting their children’s health at risk, saying it was comparable to exposing them to any other bodily fluids, while others downplayed the incident with sarcastic quips.

The US Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines for using other people’s breast milk to feed your baby explicitly advises not to use unscreened breast milk obtained through strangers or the internet, Fox News reports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Louis Tramunti’s Wife Thought He Was Having a Heart Attack. So Why Did the Police Break His Back?

He made it unscathed from Whitestone to Westchester. Then his wife called 911 and things fell apart, fast.

07.27.17 1:00 AM ET

When Louis Tramunti’s wife called 911, she wanted EMTs to save her husband’s life after a heart attack. Instead, two policemen threw him to the floor and broke his back. It was just one of those things; didn’t even make the papers.

Louis, an old friend of an old friend of mine, called me nearly a year later because “people need to know about this, bro,” which didn’t thrill his attorney.

“I’m not typically a PR lawyer,” said Steven Falkoff when I called. “It’s a basic fact pattern and excessive-force case. I don’t know how much sexiness there is for a broader story.”

To Louis—a good-natured if foul-mouthed 37-year-old Bernie-supporting son of Whitestone, a corner of Queens untouched by gentrification or even integration—it’s the only story.

He’s been married for seven years to Szilvia, a lovely Hungarian immigrant whose calmness evens out his off-the-walls hyperactivity, and he’s worked for more than 15 years as a plumbing surveyor, making good union wages mapping out where the sleeves go as new high-end Manhattan buildings rise up. Wherever Louis works now, he etches the name of their 2-year-old son, Marco, behind where the wall will be on each floor. The job puts him on top of half-finished buildings, Manhattan stretched out before him. Being up there, he says, is what made him fear thunder.

The family lives 40 miles and a world from Henry Hill or Archie Bunker’s Queens, in a split-level house in leafy Yorktown Heights, Westchester, just past the Donald J. Trump State Park (yes, no kidding; Trump donated the land in 2006) and down the road from the Elks Lodge. Before that, they lived for eight years in an apartment a few miles away in Hartsdale.

That’s where they were on April Fool’s Day 2016, a Saturday, as Szilvia drove her car into Greenburgh to have an officer do a safety check on the child seat, since Marco—a big kid, like his dad—had to start facing front. Went to dinner with them, put Marco to sleep, and went to bed herself.

Early Sunday morning, in the midst of a huge storm, the police came to them.

The thunder woke up Szilvia, and she heard a weird, loud groan and turned to shush Louis, who she figured was once again being some sort of goofy. She sees that he’s on his stomach shaking, sweating up a storm and drooling all over himself, not responding to her and still making the weird groan. So she called 911 (“for the first time in my life,” she later told The Daily Beast. “I’m a shy person”) and told the operator her husband’s having a heart attack.

She’s still on the line when the EMTs arrived, standing at the open front door of their apartment with Marco in her arms and a drop of blood on her shirt from a stress-induced nosebleed. The first responders saw her and then Louis, all 6 feet and 200 pounds of him, lurching in his underwear and walk away, telling the Greenburgh Police Officers en route to step on it.

Two officers get there and see Louis standing against a wall, eyes open but not responding to them. They approach, shine a light in his eyes, and just as he comes to and realizes they’re there, “I’m landing on my back and hitting my head at the same time.

“They had my arms pinned and their knees to my chest and they’re still shining the light in my eyes, and I’m just coming to and then they turn me around and squeeze my elbows together behind my back, and one of them has a knee in my back, and my legs go numb. I tell them I can’t breathe but the knee’s still there. I hear something crack and they crisscross my hands and cuff them and pull me up by the back and my chest starts killing me.

“They’re not saying anything to me, just dragging me out the door and Marco’s on the couch watching and someone’s saying to my wife ‘Don’t sugarcoat it, honey, we know he beat you up.’ And then I’m outside, in my fucking underwear, in the fucking snow, before all my neighbors.”

“Now, they’re talking to me: ‘We know you beat your wife.’”

“And I’m thinking: ‘Are you fucking kidding me’?”

The EMTs get outside and an officer comes with them and cuffs Louis inside the ambulance.

“This cop is telling me: ‘Yeah you beat your wife up. Is that the kind of man you are?’’

“I’m crying. I mean, I’ve never laid a hand on my wife. I had a great day. We had dinner and I played Call of Duty and fell asleep on the couch. Went into our bed and held my wife and fell back asleep. Wake up and there are the police taking me down—boom!—and telling me I beat my wife.

“I’m licking my lips and someone tells me to fucking stop so I do and I feel nauseous. Then tells me not to throw up, or it’s going to a big problem. They put a bag over my mouth.

“I’m crying. Is this who I am? Last thing I knew, I was falling asleep.

“I remember one of them saying we have a possible fifty-fifty-one or whatever and it seemed so odd. Later I realized that meant they were reporting they had a crazy or deranged person.

“So we get to the White Plains Hospital and I’m cuffed to the gurney, screaming the whole time that my ribs are killing me and that I can’t breathe. The cop from my house is there, trying to play the good-guy role and telling me, ‘Honestly, you know you really did beat up your wife tonight. You beat your wife good.’

“This doctor comes in and asks me questions and hears the way I’m staggering in my speech and right away wants to see if I had a seizure.

“Later, they put all the wiring in my head, and they told me I’d had a seizure. My first one. In fact, I had all the signs of one, bro, that the EMTs should have recognized. My wife didn’t say that when she called 911, because she’s not a doctor.

“Then they found I had four fractured vertebrae. I was in so much pain from my back and then on so much pain medication that I didn’t realize, and the doctors didn’t find until days later, that I’d also torn the tendon between my chest and my ribs.

That was long after “the cop, the same one who kept telling me I’d beaten my wife, finally took the cuffs off me.

“He said, ‘Sorry buddy. You’ll be OK.’ And then he left.”

No charges were filed.

Here’s how the night’s events come out in the colder, more cautious language of official reports. Remember everything that follows (and is sic’d throughout) is in response to Szilvia’s call to 911 saying her husband was having a heart attack:

Narrative: U/A find Pt on scene inside residence Awake and alert but non verbal standing up against the living room. Pt not responding to verbal stimuli or commands. Pt sweating, appears frightened and acting bizarre. Listed officer and Officer Maiden placed pt in restraints for pt’s safety and others on the scene. After pt was placed in cuffs he began responded to Officers. Pt reports he does not remeber getting out of bed and that the last thing he remembers wass going to sleep and then being in hand cuffs with Officers. Pt denies pain or discomfort. Pt placed on stretcher and into ambulance… Further als assessment waived in favor of patient being transported to the appropriate facility for a psych evaluation. While enroute the pt made statements like, “is this real”, as if parnoid.Pt care tansferred to stall.

Wife on scene reports her husband awoke from bed after a loud ligthing strike sound was heard outside during a storm. Pt would not listen to her and was roaming around the apartment as if he was terrified. Wife reports pt has never acted like this before and that he does not abuse drugs or alcohol. Wife reports pt was acting normal before going to bed the evening and that everything was normal.

From the police Incident/Investigation Report, about responding to “a possible ‘heart attack’”:

On approach to the residence, the Undersigned and PO Freeman observed a Greenville Fire Captain run out of the premise and state, “He is acting up in there, you better get in fast!”

On entering, the officers observed a middle aged man wearing only his boxers standing in the landing of the kitchen… (and) a white female and a young child standing in the livingroom. Both the child and the female appeared to be afraid. It should also be noted that the female was bleeding from the nose and had blood on her shirt and there were some blood droplets on the floor.

At this point, PO Freeman attempted to make vocal contact with the unknown male (later identified: as (PT) Tramunti, Louis) with negative result. The male only stared blankly at officers while sweating profusely and looking back and forth in an agitated state and obviously acting bizarre. At this time, PO Freeman and the undersigned, for the safety of the officers and all other people on the scene, decided to achieve control of the non-vocal and non-compliant PT by placing him in handcuffs and then placing him on the floor so that he could be properly assessed by PO Paramedic Freeman… The undersigned restrained PT’s legs in order to protect himself and officer freeman from being kicked during the assessment.

And from the supplemental report filed months later by the same officer, claiming that Louis “was awake and alert, sweating and appeared frightened” when the officers entered, It stresses that Szilvia and Marco, too, “appeared frightened” and that there was blood on her shirt and “droplets” on the floor:

Despite reporting that Louis was “awake and alert,” it continues: PT did not reply to verbal communication… was acting bizarre and appeared agitated. (PT stared blankly, back and forth at Officers as if confused. While on the floor in a supine position listed Officer assessed the (PT)’s vital signs… and obvious signs of trauma, which all appeared normal.

…

“When in the back of the ambulance (PT) came out of his trance like state and began asking what happened. … (PT) stated, “is this real” numerous times as if paranoid. (PT) kept asking what had happened after being told numerous times by listed Offiicer. (PT) did not complain of injury or pain other than discomfort from the hand cuffs that remained on him during the transport to the hospital.

Louis—who spent six weeks recovering before going back to work—and Szilvia are suing after rejecting a settlement offer.

Asked about the suit, Greenburgh Police Chief Chris McNerney emailed: “We are committed to vigorously defending yet another frivolous lawsuit against a police department. We are looking forward to the facts being presented in a court of law, as there is not one credible piece of evidence to support this outrageous claim.”

Also looking forward to an accounting and a judgment is Louis, who’s still fuming 15 months later about falling asleep with his family and waking up with his back broken, being told he’d beat his wife.

“On a work site,” he says, if a storm is coming and the winds get above 25 miles per hour, you get everyone off the roof to keep them safe and, in the process, ensure your own bottom line. How is it that cops,” he asks, “are held to such a lower bar?”

He’s furious that the department’s new body-camera program hadn’t rolled out when the police showed up at his door. About how, if he loses the suit, he may have to pay the department’s legal fees. “They have the nerve to do this. That’s intimidation. That’s bullshit.”

And he’s worried about his sex life—“I’m an Italian guy from Queens who was in a body cast. It is what it is, and it isn’t good”—while Szilvia’s worried about his health and earnings to support Marco and, she hopes, his future siblings.

The legal issue here is a much narrower one, says Falkoff, Louis’ lawyer, “focused on the amount of force they used in arresting him and the perceptions of the officers as it’s unfolding. This wasn’t 20 minutes but 15 or 20 seconds. EMS tells the cops to get in there fast, because they see the wife bleeding and Louis out of it. Cops get there and maybe it’s reasonable to take Louis down to the floor when he doesn’t respond. It’s the amount of force they used to take him down that’s the issue here.”

For Louis, it comes down to right and wrong.

“I never, ever beat anybody up, been drunk in public, had any issue with the police, done anything. I live for my son and my wife, my family, and I work hard. I don’t expect this to happen to me or anybody for that matter.

“How is it that no one can say, ‘We’re sorry and that was wrong’?”

“It’s insane. I have to see doctors and a physical therapist and also someone for PTSD now. I’m back at work, but I can’t talk about it with anyone there. There’s no support group for this. And when I tell my black friend, he just says ‘that’s how it is.’

“That’s not right. That’s not how it should be. I’m trying to tell white people: They’re coming for you, too, bro.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    World news in pictures

Video footage showed the tank accelerate to meet the car as it raced towards the checkpoint.

The tank retreated as civilians ran for cover, at which point the car exploded and nearby civilians were caught in the blast.

An army spokesman said the attack could have killed 50-60 people had it reached its target.

“The explosion was large, carrying about 100kg of high explosives,” the statement said.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

An insurgency in Egypt's Sinai region has gained pace since the army toppled President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's oldest Islamist movement, following mass protests against his rule in mid-2013.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A 50-year-old German man has been killed and six people injured in a knife attack in a Hamburg supermarket, German police say.

Police said the suspect was 26 years old and born in the United Arab Emirates. They said he acted alone and he was overpowered by passersby.

It was too soon to pinpoint a motive, they tweeted.

There are unconfirmed reports that he shouted "Allahu akhbar", Arabic for "God is great" while attacking people.

Police said they were still seeking to confirm his current nationality.

The man attacked customers in the supermarket at random, ran outside and was chased by customers and by people outside the shop. They brought him to the ground before he was detained by plain-clothes police officers.

A 50-year-old woman and four men aged between 19 and 64 were stabbed, while a 35-year-old man was injured while helping overcome the suspect.

The attack happened in the Barmbek region in the north of the city in a branch of Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket chain.

Police say the man's weapon may have looked like a machete but they are, for now, assuming it was a kitchen knife.

One eyewitness made a gesture about 50cm (20 in) long when asked on German TV how big the knife was.

Asked whether this was a terror attack, a police official told the BBC: "We are at an early stage of the investigation... At the moment we can't rule anything out. We are investigating all avenues."

Speculation in German media said the attack may have been part of a robbery attempt but police said that that motive could not be confirmed.

One eyewitness, who ran from the scene into a nearby shop as the situation unfolded, told German broadcaster NTV that it seemed "hectic and confused, not like a properly planned attack".

The newspaper reported that the child and her mother are also set to be prosecuted under the Child Marriages Restraint Act, which sets the minimum marriageable age of a female at 16.

The charity Girls not Brides believes that 21 per cent of Pakistani women are married by the age of 18, often with little say in the matter.

The Pakistani National Assembly rejected a proposal to raise the minimum marriageable age for females to 18, in line with that for males.

In a recent series of widely criticised rulings, the Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional body which gives Islamic legal advice to the Pakistani Government, declared that laws prohibiting child marriage are un-Islamic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    If approved, the rate increase would be phased in over two years. The first increase would occur in the summer of 2018 and the full rate would go into affect in early 2019. I&M says a residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month would see an increase of less than $1 per day.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration the average Indiana household averaged 964 kilowatt hours per month in 2015.

“I&M’s plan prepares the company for a future of energy generation that is more diverse and will allow us to offer our customers new, cleaner energy options. The plan will improve customers’ service through investments in infrastructure that will reduce outages and directly limit service interruptions caused by severe weather,” said Toby Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer of I&M. “We intend to better serve our communities by renovating aging equipment, modernizing the delivery system with new technology and improving the reliability of service while being mindful of the cost impacts on our customers.”

The Building the Future program would also allow the utility to create a systematic, four-year tree trimming program. I&M says the number one source of customer outages is trees and other vegetation.

If approved, the rate increase would give I&M an additional $263 million a year in revenue.

I&M asked for a rate increase in 2011 but was only awarded about half of its proposal by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

Also, I&M wants to increase the minimum customer charge, also called a fixed charge. That increase would go from $7.30 to $18. The minimum charge increase would be on top of the base rate increase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    www.journalgazette.net

Shepherd's House on Tennessee Avenue near Spy Run apparently will lose federal funding used to offer transitional housing to homeless military veterans.

Shepherd's House grant denied

VA mute as to reason; director of homeless vets center stunned

BRIAN FRANCISCO | The Journal Gazette

Shepherd's House, a Fort Wayne faith-based organization that provides transitional housing�for homeless military veterans, might launch a community fund drive, curtail�its services or close its doors because of the pending loss of federal funds.

Shepherd's House co-founder Barb Cox said Thursday that the Department of Veterans Affairs apparently has denied its application for a grant worth about $496,000 a year. A similar grant has�accounted for the bulk�of the organization's $622,000 yearly budget, with the rest coming from private sources.

“We're just completely thrown for a loop, honestly,” Cox said in a telephone interview.

“We've given everything for this ministry for the last�20 years, and we've seen miracle after miracle. ... I can't even let my mind ponder God not moving and making this possible again,” she said.

Shepherd's House has�40 beds for VA-qualified homeless veterans at its Tennessee Avenue building�near Spy Run. It has been receiving grant money since 2009 through VA's�Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program, called GPD for short. The grant amounts to $46 a day for each veteran served.

VA announced�in December that it would terminate�GPD�grants dating back to 1994 and�require recipients to reapply for funding by April 4.�VA said in its termination notice that it would turn the GPD into a competitive, performance-based yearly grant program.�Existing grants expire Sept.�30, and funds�will run out Dec.�31.

“We were told clearly�that 97 percent of all the existing programs would be funded, and we knew we couldn't fall in that (remaining) 3 percent because we're not just a cot and a meal, we've got a huge clinical treatment program here,” Cox said about Shepherd's House.

She said judges from a half-dozen court systems “will only refer here, because this program is so good. I never expected not to be funded.”

Cox said she�has never received written�notice from VA that the Shepherd's House grant application had been�rejected. She said she called a VA employee�in Tampa, Florida, to ask about the application and was told, “Oh, it's not good.”

VA officials in Washington, D.C., had not responded to requests for comment by Thursday night.

Liberty Landing, a transitional housing complex for homeless veterans on South Calhoun Street, received word that�its GPD application�had been approved, according to its owner, faith-based�Volunteers of America of Indiana. Mike Lloyd, vice president of operations for the Indianapolis-based Volunteers,�said�he did not know how much VA money the�40-bed facility would receive.

Asked about the future of Shepherd's House without federal funds, Cox said�one prospect is “really, really scaling back”�medical, psychological and other services for homeless veterans.�Another option is asking for�financial contributions from Fort Wayne�organizations, foundations and residents.

“I'm praying that the community steps up�and somehow makes this go on,” she said.

Asked whether�closing is an option, Cox said: “Well, we're 30,000 square feet. You can't make an operation this big continue without funding. So I don't want to say those words out loud, but I mean, it's just obvious.”

Rep. Jim Banks, R-3rd, wrote�a letter Wednesday to VA Secretary David Shulkin seeking details on the agency's decision to deny GPD funding to Shepherd's House. He wrote�that “to date no official explanation for this decision has been provided.”

Banks, a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, noted in his letter that Cox and her husband, Shepherd's House co-founder Lonnie Cox, received�Indiana's highest civilian honor, the Sagamore of the Wabash, from�then-Gov. Mike Pence, now the nation's vice president, in 2016.

While applauding VA efforts to improve its services for homeless veterans, Banks added,�“In the wake of these changes, organizations are running out of time to navigate a course for the future.” He wrote�that Indianapolis-based Hoosier Veteran Assistance Foundation did not get an official explanation for a reduction in its�GPD funding.

Banks is�not the only member of Congress�trying to get answers. The Journal Times of Racine County, Wisconsin, reported last week that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis.,�have�written to�Shulkin�to ask why their state's veterans affairs agency�has lost a $500,000 federal VA grant for aiding homeless veterans.

VA said last year on its website that the GPD has supported more than 600 homeless veterans projects and 13,800 beds nationwide. The program served roughly 44,700 homeless veterans in fiscal 2016, with more than 16,500 of them finding permanent housing, according to the website.

The�VA notice to terminate grants stated that�the agency “expects to fund 24 existing service centers and 12,000 beds” under its new plan, in which grants would fit�five housing models. Shepherd's House had applied under the clinical and hospital-to-housing models, while Liberty Landing applied under bridge housing for short stays and service-intensive transitioning.�

The December VA notice stated�that “the�allocation of these grants needs to be�updated to reflect the documented�current need as well as to increase the�flexibility to adapt to future needs.”

The nation's homeless veteran population declined�by nearly 50�percent�between�2010�and 2016, when it was about 39,400,�according to federal estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    LARGO — Police say the father whose 8-month-old was left in a bedroom with no air conditioning was told the day before the infant's death to keep his children in another room.

William Francis Hendrickson, 25, now faces several charges after police found his son lifeless in a playpen on Thursday.

The bedroom at the S Belcher Road mobile home was 109 degrees when police arrived. The baby's body temperature was 105.6 degrees and Hendrickson's daughter, 2, was immediately sent to Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital for dehydration, according to a police affidavit.

Police said they performed CPR on the boy until paramedics arrived. The infant could not be resuscitated and died at the scene.

Meanwhile, the children's mother sat in a jail cell, arrested days earlier on a battery charge.

About 12:30 p.m. on Thursday, Largo police officers responded to assist Pinellas County Child Protection investigators with a welfare check on the two children at the King's Manor Estates mobile home park at 1399 S Belcher Rd. lot 112.

Child services had told the father the day before not to leave the children in the bedroom, police said, but Hendrickson said he had "no where else to go" after his girlfriend was arrested the week before on charges she fought with his mother.

"He kept the children confined in the bedroom with him to avoid his live-in parents," police wrote.

On Saturday, the children's mother, Elizabeth Michelle Rutenbeck, 24, was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of battery. According to an arrest report, Rutenbeck tried to force her way into Hendrickson's mother's bedroom in the mobile home.

"The defendant then pushed through the victim to get an Xbox from inside the victim's room," the report says.

Rutenbeck was booked into the Pinellas County jail. Already on probation for felony charges of grand theft, she is being held without bail.

Two days later, Hendrickson's mother, Carrie Hendrickson, filed a domestic violence petition against Rutenbeck. She identified Rutenbeck as her son's "baby mama." In it, Carrie Hendrickson wrote that Rutenbeck injured her neck and knee and that a door she damaged needs to be replaced.

"All her belongings need to be removed from premises," she wrote.

On Friday at 10 a.m., detectives knocked on the mobile home's door. The woman who answered barked, "My grandson is dead because you did not do your job," before allowing them inside.

Hendrickson faces charges of aggravated child neglect for the condition of his daughter and aggravated manslaughter in the death of his son, according to police. He has had no arrests prior to Thursday in Florida, records show.

Police said citizens need to be reminded of the dangers of Florida's scorching temperatures, particularly in confined or poorly ventilated spaces and "especially for children, the elderly, and those with special medical concerns."

Hendrickson was booked into Pinellas County Jail on Thursday night and is being held on $150,000 bail.

Mike Bobbitt has lived one lot down from the Hendrickson's cream colored and red-trimmed home for 15 years.

LONDON — Charlie Gard, the critically ill British baby at the center of a legal battle that attracted the attention of Pope Francis and U.S. President Donald Trump, has died. He would have turned 1 next week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “The State is ordered to comply with the DEA’s administrative subpoena within 21 days of issuance of this Order or face contempt sanctions upon motion made by the DEA,” U.S. District Court Judge David Nuffer wrote in the order.

The Utah Attorney General’s Office told FOX 13 on Friday it was reviewing the opinion and any potential options for appeal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    North Korea has fired an an intercontinental ballistic missile which may have landed in Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), according to the country's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

The zone reaches 200 nautical miles from the country's coast. Mr Abe has called an emergency meeting of the National Security Council.

"I have received information that North Korea once again conducted a missile firing," Mr Abe said. "We will immediately analyze information and do our utmost to protect the safety of the Japanese people."

He called on the US, South Korea, Russia and China to increase pressure on the secretive state over its missile launches, which have defied international rulings.

Trump on North Korea: There are consequences for their bad behaviour

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Japan "absolutely cannot tolerate" repeated provocations from North Korea, also known as the DPRK.

Soon after reports of the launch emerged from Japan, the Pentagon and South Korean military officials confirmed they detected a ballistic missile launch from North Korea.

On Friday evening, Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said: "The US Department of Defence detected and tracked a single North Korea missile launch today. We assess that this missile was an intercontinental ballistic missile, as had been expected.

"The missile was launched from Mupyong-ni and travelled about 1,000km before splashing down in the Sea of Japan. We are working with our interagency partners on a more detailed assessment.

"The North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.

"Our commitment to the defence of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad. We are prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation."

Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis said the lengthy flight time meant the missile was likely a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), potentially capable of travelling 10,000km and hitting a target in the US.

According to Yonhap news agency, South Korean military officials said the missile was launched from Jagang Province, in the north of the DPRK.

South Korea has also called a national security meeting.

The night time launch of the ICBM was unusual, as most take place around dawn. Dr. John Nilsson-Wright, senior research fellow on Chatham House's Asia programme, told The Independent this could have been to demonstrate the military was capable of launching in varying conditions.

Alternatively, Dr Nilsson-Wright said, "maybe the element of surprise is part of the reason why they wanted to do this".

He added: "I think they've shown that they have the capability, the increased technical sophistication, and I think there will be a lot of anxiety in Seoul and Tokyo."

It comes just one day after the 64th anniversary of the end of the Korean War -- known as Victory Day in the North.

International tensions have been mounting over the nuclear ambitions of North Korea in recent months, and Donald Trump has threatened to "take care" of the unstable situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Just over two years after candidate Donald Trump mocked John McCain's Vietnam War record, noting that he prefers heroes "who weren't captured", the Arizona senator stuck a dagger in President Trump's healthcare reform plans.

There were gasps when Mr McCain, after being furiously lobbied by Vice-President Mike Pence, joined two other Republican senators in voting against the so-called "skinny" repeal plan, considered the bare minimum Senate Republicans could agree on.

Instead of a big step toward becoming law - either in its skinny form or after further negotiations with the House of Representatives - the future of Obamacare repeal has been thrown into doubt.

The reality is, for now, there is no minimum level of change on which Senate Republicans can agree. They either have to work with Democrats or resign themselves to stalemate and move on to other topics, like taxes or infrastructure spending.

It will take some time for the scale of this late-night Senate drama to sink in. No one really expected Mr McCain to be the decisive vote, but the man who once had a reputation as a Republican "maverick", now facing a dire brain cancer diagnosis, had at least one more surprise in his pocket.

What was the 'skinny repeal'?

The bill - officially known as the Health Care Freedom Act - would have eliminated parts of Obamacare - the Affordable Care Act - including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance coverage or pay a fine, and the employer mandate, which requires the same of companies with 50 employees or more.

It also would have temporarily repealed a tax on medical devices, defund the US women's group Planned Parenthood for a year and provide more money to community health centres, as well as given states more flexibility in complying with Obamacare regulations.

But the pared-down measure would have left much of Obamacare untouched, including the expansion of Medicaid, a government health programme for the poor that faced deep cuts in earlier proposals.

A requirement that all insurance plans cover essential health benefits, federal subsidies to help consumers pay for insurance as well as taxes on wealthy Americans also would have remained in place.

The stripped down bill came after earlier Senate defeats for proposals to replace Obamacare and then to partially repeal it.

Sen McCain said he had voted against the skinny repeal because it did not amount to meaningful reform and would not have improved care for Americans.

He added that House Speaker Paul Ryan's assurance that the House would be willing to send the bill for further consideration by committee "did not ease my concern that this shell of a bill could be taken up and passed at any time".

What now for Obamacare?

There are not thought to be any further plans for a new bill to repeal Obamacare because the skinny repeal was seen as the only measure Republicans could get through Congress.

However, lawmakers could revive the issue and take it up later in the year.

Following the vote, President Trump tweeted: "As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal."

Mr Trump's position on healthcare reform has varied - he has spoken out at various points for Obamacare being repealed, repealed and replaced, or being allowed to collapse by itself.

In his statement, Mr McCain said Obamacare was in a state of "collapse", with healthcare premiums "skyrocketing" and providers "fleeing the marketplace".

He criticised the way Obamacare had been passed by Democrats using their Obama-era majority and called for senators to "return to the correct way of legislating" with input from both parties.

"We must do the hard work our citizens expect of us and deserve," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) project called “Imperial” included three hacking tools for infiltrating the Mac and Linux operating systems, according to the latest “Vault 7” leaks.

Cyber security in the Middle East

It is not just western countries such as the US and the UK that are being targeted by hackers, as the rapidly developed and wealthy nations of the Middle East become targets of both politically and financially driven attacks. Discover how cyber security expertise can help businesses in the Middle East navigate digital transformations and keep cyber criminals at bay.

WikiLeaks claims that a source provided portions of an archive of the CIA’s hacking arsenal, including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponised “zero day” exploits and malware remote control systems that was circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorised manner.

The latest documents to be leaked detail hacking tools called Achilles, Aeris and SeaPea.

According to the documents, Achilles is aimed at enabling CIA agents to “trojan an [Mac] OS X disk image (.dmg) installer with one or more desired operator specified executables for a one-time execution”.

SeaPea is designed to function as a Mac OS X rootkit for versions 10.6 and 10.7 to allow CIA agents to infiltrate a system while it reboots to carry out monitoring operations and launch tools.

SeaPea’s manual was previously released by WikiLeaks in another Vault 7 release named DarkSeaSkies, which detailed hacking tools targeting Macs and iPhones.

Aeris is described as an automated implant written in the C programming language that targets Linux distributions, including Debian, Red Hat, Solaris, FreeBSD and CentOS.

The documents claim Aeris is designed to function as a backdoor to these Linux distributions and can be used to build customised implants tailored for specific operations.

There is a lot of “fog” surrounding cyber weapons and cyber war because there is no way of knowing the true capability of any country, says security expert Mikko Hypponen.

Aeris supports “automated file exfiltration, configurable beacon interval and jitter, standalone and Collide-based HTTPS LP support and SMTP protocol support – all with TLS encrypted communications with mutual authentication”, according to WikiLeaks.

WikiLeaks says the documents indicate the scope of the CIA’s global covert hacking programme, its malware arsenal and dozens of “zero day” weaponised exploits against a wide range of US and European company products.

WikiLeaks claims that since 2001, the CIA has gained political and budgetary pre-eminence over the US National Security Agency (NSA) and built its own group of hackers.

By the end of 2016, says WikiLeaks, the CIA’s hacking division had more than 5,000 registered users and had produced more than 1,000 hacking systems, trojans, viruses and other “weaponised” malware, creating, in effect, its “own NSA” but with “even less accountability”.

WikiLeaks said the source of the Vault 7 leaks suggested there were policy questions that urgently needed to be debated in public, including whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.

“The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons,” said WikiLeaks.

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo and Co said it would reimburse about $80 million to 570,000 customers who may have been charged wrongly due to issues related to auto collateral protection insurance (CPI) policies.

Wells Fargo has been engulfed in scandal since September, when it reached a $190 million settlement with regulators over complaints that its retail banking staff had opened as many as 2.1 million unauthorized client accounts.

The bank had fired 5,300 employees for improper sales tactics over five years, but did not make much changes to policies and procedures, or hold managers accountable until there was a public outcry.

Wells Fargo said late Thursday it would pay back $80 million to customers wrongly charged for car loan insurance in the coming months, which included $64 million in cash and $16 million of account adjustments.

"We take full responsibility for our failure to appropriately manage the CPI program and are extremely sorry for any harm this caused our customers," said Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo Consumer Lending.

The bank said it had started a review of the CPI program in July 2016 and discontinued the program in September, based on the findings.

New York Times reported earlier that more than 800,000 people who took car loans from Wells Fargo were charged for auto insurance they did not need, and some of the customers were still paying for it. nyti.ms/2tIdyUE

About 490,000 customers had duplicate vehicle insurance coverage and about 60,000 customers did not receive complete disclosures from vendors, prior to CPI coverage, Wells Fargo said.

For about 20,000 customers, additional costs of the CPI could have led to defaults resulting in seizure of their vehicles. The bank said these customers would receive additional payments as compensation for the loss of their vehicles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will explore cutting the level of nicotine in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels, a radical step that would reshape the $130 billion American tobacco industry and potentially encourage millions of people to quit smoking.

The move, announced Friday, would represent one of the most sweeping federal efforts to reduce smoking since Congress required cigarette packages to carry health warnings in 1965. It follows other moves by President Donald Trump’s FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to try and deal with the high cost of prescription drugs and opioid addiction, two issues not directly within the agency’s traditional mandate.

Tobacco stocks plunged after the announcement, which came just hours after the failure of Republicans’ effort to repeal and replace much of the Affordable Care Act. The FDA’s move is likely to set off a lobbying fight in Washington, even as it pushes the industry to move faster in the development of new products that rely less on burning tobacco and more on potentially lower-risk technologies like vaping.

“The overwhelming amount of death and disease attributable to tobacco is caused by addiction to cigarettes -- the only legal consumer product that, when used as intended, will kill half of all long-term users,” Gottlieb said in a statement announcing the move. “Unless we change course, 5.6 million young people alive today will die prematurely later in life from tobacco use.”

Gottlieb also said regulators will look at banning menthol and flavored-products because of their potential for attracting young people. An administration official said the White House supports the move, and disagreed that it was a break from Trump’s anti-regulation agenda.

Tobacco Innovation

In a briefing Friday, he called nicotine both the “problem” and “ultimately, the solution.” Along with nicotine reduction, the FDA plans to ease the path of entry for less-harmful nicotine delivery systems. The FDA “must also recognize potential for innovation to lead to less harmful products,” Gottlieb said in the briefing.

“I’ve pledged a deep commitment to taking aggressive steps to address the epidemic of addiction to opioids,” Gottlieb said. “I view our opportunity to confront addiction to nicotine with the same obligation. I’ll pursue efforts to reduce addiction to nicotine with the same vigor.”

While reducing nicotine is bad news for the cigarette business, the impact could be tempered for companies like Philip Morris International Inc. and Altria Group Inc., which have been putting more emphasis on innovations they say have less health risks. Philip Morris has spent over $3 billion on developing its reduced-risk portfolio.

“This was a big surprise and will make it imperative that domestic tobacco companies strive to develop innovative, safer products,” said Jack Russo, an analyst with Edward Jones & Co. who follows the tobacco industry.

Shares of Altria dropped as much as 19 percent, the biggest intraday decline since 1999. British American Tobacco’s stock fell as much as 14 percent.

“Until the eventual development of specific proposals, it’s too early to understand the practical implications,” said Simon Evans, a spokesman for Imperial Brands Plc, a Bristol, U.K.-based tobacco manufacturer that sells Winston and Kool cigarettes. Shares of the company fell as much as 9.5 percent.

Unexpected

The move caught some in Washington by surprise. Representative Robert Aderholt, the Alabama Republican who runs the congressional subcommittee overseeing the FDA budget, said Gottlieb called earlier in the day to give him a heads up on the new policy.

“I’m still trying to get my arms around it,” said Aderholt.

The Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-smoking advocacy group that’s been active in past tobacco regulatory changes, said it didn’t get a preview of the announcement. Staff were gathered in a conference room watching Gottlieb’s announcement when they got the news, Becky Wexler, a spokeswoman, said via email.

FDA Authority

The FDA gained oversight of tobacco products in 2009 through the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. The law said that agency had “the authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other harmful components of tobacco products.”

Developing regulations around the proposal will take time, and is likely to create fierce debate.

“The FDA plans to begin a public dialogue about lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to nonaddictive levels through achievable product standards,” the agency said in the announcement.

Representatives of Philip Morris and Altria didn’t respond to requests for comment. British American Tobacco’s Reynolds American division said it was encouraged by the move and that the FDA had recognized “tobacco harm reduction policies and the continuum of risk for tobacco products.”

Sales of cigarettes have already been in decline, hurt in part by rising taxes. The industry’s cigarette sales volume dropped an estimated 4.5 percent last quarter, Altria reported earlier this week. The average state excise tax was $1.74 per pack last quarter, compared with 19 cents for the same time last year, according to Altria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A congressional information technology staffer was arrested Monday evening before a scheduled flight for Lahore, Pakistan, and charged with bank fraud in connection with a $165,000 loan from the congressional Federal Credit Union, authorities said.

Imran Awan, 37, pleaded not guilty Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey in Washington and was released to a high-intensity supervision program whose conditions include GPS monitoring, a nighttime curfew and staying within a 50-mile radius of his home in Lorton, federal prosecutors said. He was arrested at Dulles International Airport, his attorney said.

Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, allegedly secured a $165,000 home equity loan in January from CFCU on a house in Alexandria after claiming it was their primary residence, when it was a rental property, FBI Special Agent Brandon C. Merriman wrote in an affidavit for Awan’s arrest. The couple told the credit union to wire the money to Pakistan for use in purchasing a property, Merriman wrote.

Alvi, also a former House IT worker, and the couple’s three school-aged children, were approached by federal agents but allowed to board a flight to Lahore on March 5 Merriman wrote, but he said that he “does not believe that Alvi has any intention to return to the United States.”

Awan’s attorney, Chris Gowen, said in a statement, “Because we are confident in the integrity of the U.S. justice system, we are confident that Mr. Awan will soon be able to clear his name and get on with his life. Neither Mr. Awan nor his wife have ever had any intention to ‘flee’ the United States.”

“They are U.S. citizens who have built a full life and have a strong community life in this country. They will stand and fight whatever charges are presented,” Gowen said. The couple had round trip tickets, and Awan had informed the government of his plans to travel, Gowen said.

Awan had worked for the House since 2004 as a shared employee, getting paid about $165,000 per year from about a dozen Democratic members in 2015 and 2016, for example, according to Legistorm. Most payments ended by early February, the congressional data tracking service reported.

Awan worked most recently for U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), before he was fired Tuesday, her spokesman said.

“Mr. Awan previously served as an employee in our office, but his services have been terminated,” David Damron said.

A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office of the District and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Capitol Police declined to comment, citing the pending case.

Border officers appeared to encourage teen to drink from bottle containing liquid meth

A government surveillance video obtained by ABC News has shed new light on a tragic incident at the U.S.-Mexico border, sparking outrage from members of Congress who help oversee U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The video shows that in 2013 two U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers appeared to encourage, or at least permit, a 16-year-old Mexican high school student to drink from a bottle that tests would later reveal contained concentrated liquid methamphetamine.

The young man, Cruz Velazquez, died within two hours of drinking the substance, but the two officers involved, Valerie Baird and Adrian Perallon, remain on the job today, with no disciplinary action taken against them.

A former head of internal affairs at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, James Tomsheck, told ABC News the two officers violated agency protocols by allowing the young man to drink from the bottle, and that he was told at the time they would be punished.

"If they truly suspected there was a controlled substance in the bottle," Tomsheck said, "they should've conducted a field test."

Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California and the ranking member on the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, condemned the officers' conduct.

"Drug smuggling is wrong and is a crime, but this teenage boy did not deserve a death sentence," Lofgren told ABC News. "For CBP officers to inflict a summary death sentence is not only immoral, but also illegal."

Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Missouri and the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, echoed those sentiments.

"In order for CBP officers to prevent smuggling, ensure public safety, and do their difficult job at the border properly, CBP must have the appropriate protocols in place and officers must follow them," Thompson told ABC News. "While there is no excuse for attempting to bring illicit substances into the country, it is absolutely clear from the video that there were numerous failures in judgement and procedure that led to the senseless death of a 16-year-old boy. CBP must ensure that such a tragedy never occurs again."

The video, which will air for the first time today on Good Morning America, World News Tonight with David Muir, 20/20 and Nightline as part of a year-long investigation of U.S. Customs and Border Protection conducted by ABC News and The Investigative Fund, shows that Velazquez took four drinks from the bottle, and the officers appear to repeatedly encourage him with hand gestures.

The Velazquez family ultimately filed a civil lawsuit against the officers and the agency, claiming that the officers' actions led to Cruz's death.

"What you see, I think, is a basic lack of compassion and decency toward a 16-year-old boy," said Gene Iredale, the San Diego-based attorney who represented the Velazquez family. "Almost a delight that you would see in children who just pull the wings off flies slowly, a smile when he's being asked to drink something and being put in this position."

Both officers, who declined through their attorneys to be interviewed by ABC News, denied asking Velazquez to drink from the bottle, and the official report called the incident an "accident." Officer Perallon claimed Velazquez "volunteered" to take a drink.

In response to the broader ABC News investigation, which revealed a history of cases in which the agency appeared to ignore accusations of mistreatment and abuse, the agency issued a statement, saying, "CBP takes all allegations of mistreatment seriously, and does not tolerate actions that are not consistent with our core values of vigilance, service to country and integrity."

The Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego released a brief statement to ABC News.

"The Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego provided consular and legal assistance to Mr. Cruz Velazquez's family since it learned about his death. This tragic incident highlights the need of greater transparency and accountability in immigration control activities."

Earlier this year, the U.S. government paid the teen's family $1 million to settle a lawsuit. There was no apology or admission of wrongdoing, and both officers testified that they never received a reprimand for their conduct, a fact that still angers members of Velazquez's family.

"How can the government allow that? It's like, OK you can kill someone," Reyna Velazquez, Cruz's sister, told ABC News. "They took him as a fool, as who cares. Well, that fool, he was the greatest person I ever knew."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A corrections officer was placed on administrative leave after pulling a gun on an ATV rider in North Pole while he was off duty.

According to the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, GoPro video footage taken May 29 by an all-terrain vehicle rider named Devarge Walker shows him riding down a gravel road when Gregory Braeuer, an off-duty corrections officer at the Fairbanks Correctional Center, gets out of his pickup, approaches Walker and says, "This ain't a racetrack."

Braeuer reaches for the ATV, and a struggle ensues. Walker tells Braeuer to "get the f–k off my bike. The f–k's wrong with you?" Braeuer responds, "What's wrong with you?"

Then Braeuer goes back to his truck, takes out a gun and walks toward Walker.

"Get on the ground right now," Braeuer says. After that point the GoPro camera moves and is facing part of the ATV. Braeuer references his badge and repeats himself: "Get on the f–king ground." Walker gets on the ground.

An argument ensues, and Walker tells Braeuer he is being recorded. Walker's friends are also heard talking.

Braeuer "is currently on administrative leave pending further administrative hearings," Alaska Department of Corrections spokesperson Megan Edge said in an email.

Charlie Gard, the baby whose fate was the subject of a protracted court battle and made headlines around the world, has died, his parents have said.

They fought a five-month campaign to have him transferred from Great Ormond Street hospital, where he was on life support for experimental treatment they hoped could give Charlie, who was blind and deaf and could not breath without a ventilator, “a meaningful life”. But they abandoned their legal battle on Monday, saying it was too late to save him. On Thursday he was transferred to an unspecified hospice and he died the next day, a week before he would have turned one, after having his life support systems withdrawn.

In a statement, Charlie’s mother, Connie Yates, said: “Our beautiful little boy has gone. We are so proud of you, Charlie.”

Prime Minister Theresa May said she was “deeply saddened” by his death and her “thoughts and prayers” were with his parents.

After his parents accepted he had no realistic prospect of improvement, blaming the deterioration in his muscles while they were battling Gosh, whose doctors believed the experimental treatment would not work and only prolong Charlie’s suffering the couple fought further battles against Gosh in increasingly acrimonious proceedings.

But in the face of opposition from Gosh, which said the invasive ventilation required by Charlie was not deliverable at home, they agreed with the hospital that he would be transferred to a hospice for his final hours.

But still the parties disagreed with the family wanting to keep him alive for several days but the hospital saying that would require a 24/7 intensive care team which was impossible to find for a hospice setting.

The judge, Mr Justice gave the parents time to find such a team but they were unsuccessful and he directed that an alternative plan should be put in place involving a much shorter time spent at the hospice on life support, the details of which were were not made public.

Hundreds of people, who called themselves Charlie’s Army, supported the campaign for him to receive treatment in the US, raising £1.35m.

A spokeswoman for Gosh said on Thursday: “The risk of an unplanned and chaotic end to Charlie’s life is an unthinkable outcome for all concerned and would rob his parents of precious last moments with him.

“As the judge has now ruled, we will arrange for Charlie to be transferred to a specialist children’s hospice, whose remarkable and compassionate staff will support his family at this impossible time.”

Charlie had a form of mitochondrial disease, a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and brain damage, although his parents claimed the hospital was wrong in saying he had already suffered severe irreversible brain damage. Yates and Gard also disputed with Gosh that their son was in pain.

Earlier this month, Pope Francis said he had been following the case closely and hoped that Charlie’s parents would be able to “accompany and treat their child until the end”. The Vatican children’s hospital also offered to take over his care from Gosh.

Shortly afterwards, Trump tweeted: “If we can help little Charlie Gard, as per our friends in the UK and the pope, we would be delighted to do so.”

Gard and Yates, both in their 30s from Bedfont, west London, went back to the high court this month after claiming they had new evidence of the prospects of the NBT therapy being successful. But at an emotional court hearing on Monday, which saw both parents in tears, as well as lawyers, members of the public and press said they were finally abandoning the case, paying tribute to Charlie as

“absolute warrior”.

In a statement, Yates read out from the witness box in the packed courtroom in central London, Yates said: “Mummy and Daddy love you so much, Charlie, we always have and we always will, and we are so sorry that we couldn’t save you. We had the chance, but we weren’t allowed to give you that chance. Sweet dreams baby. Sleep tight, our beautiful little boy.”

Yates said time had been wasted and “had Charlie been given the treatment sooner, he would have had the potential to be a normal, healthy little boy”.

But doctors at Gosh did not agree, with lawyers representing the hospital saying the “clinical picture” six months ago had shown irreversible damage to Charlie’s brain.

Over the course of the legal dispute, a worldwide campaign mobilised in support of Charlie’s parents, raising £1.3m. But some supporters made death threats, condemned by Francis and Gard and Yates, against Gosh doctors and staff. A hospital spokeswoman said on Friday: “Everyone at Great Ormond Street Hospital sends their heartfelt condolences to Charlie’s parents and loved-ones at this very sad time.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Two Sikh Americans killed in the US

WASHINGOTN: Two Sikh Americans have been killed in two separate incidents in one week in California, according to community organisations and media reports.

Subag Singh, 68, was found dead in a canal after he went missing in the morning of June 23. His body had injuries.

California law enforcement officials from Fresno county have said that they were trying to find out who was responsible for the killing of the elderly Sikh American.

"Deputies found his body with visible trauma in a canal on McCall and Jensen. Investigators are trying to piece together what led up to the body being found in a canal," Fox26 news said in a report.

Deputies are not saying if this was a hate crime or not, but members of the Sikh community say this would not be the first, it said.

"Honestly, we are very hurt, it just hurts us. And it just we then, think what else do we need to do," Gurdeep Shergill, a local community leader, was quoted as saying.

In a separate incident, Simranjit Singh, 20, of Elk Grove was shot dead on July 25 outside a gas station where he worked.

According to Sacramento Bee news, he was shot dead by men who had earlier assaulted his co-worker.

"At this point in both investigations, it is unclear if either of these crimes were racially motivated but we are working with both local and federal laws enforcement authorities to ensure these murders are thoroughly investigated and that the local jurisdictions are treating the cases with the utmost importance," said Sikh American Legal Defence and Education Fund (SALDEF).

"These attacks are inexcusable and we offer our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of Subag Singh and Simranjit Singh.

"We call upon local and federal law enforcement agencies to thoroughly investigate these heinous crimes and classify them as hate incidents if hate is show to be a motive," SALDEF executive director Baldev Singh said.

There have been a number of attacks targeting Indian- Americans and Sikhs in the recent months in the US.

In March, a 39-year-old Sikh man was shot in the arm outside his home in Kent, Washington, by a partially-masked gunman who shouted "go back to your own country".

In February, 32-year-old Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed when a US Navy veteran opened fire at him and his friend Alok Madasani, yelling "get out of my country"

‘It is just a beginning,’ Imran Khan, Pakistan's opposition leader and a petitioner in the high-profile Panama case, said as he hailed the Supreme Court's decision to disqualify Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Pakistan's Supreme Court disqualified 67-year-old Sharif for dishonesty and ruled that corruption cases be filed against him and his children over the Panama Papers scandal, forcing the embattled leader out of office.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Police body cam footage of man tased in back prompts $110K settlement

However, police board said tasing was “reasonable, appropriate, and within policy.”

Body cam footage of an Aurora, Colorado, cop tasing an unarmed black man in the back paved the way for the city to pay $110,000 to settle police abuse allegations, the man's lawyers told Ars Thursday.

Footage from September's tasing shows two black men being questioned by police who are responding to a weapons incident at a nearby apartment building. One of the men is seen and overheard on the video demanding to know why he's being questioned. "For what... ?" he says.

The victim, Darsean Kelley, then appears to thump his chest with his right hand and yell, "I know my rights." He's then tased in the back, loses his faculties, and falls flat on his back. He begins screaming uncontrollably, according to the video. Adding insult to injury, he's also arrested, charged with failure to obey police, and then jailed for three days because he's unable to post bail.

Body cams and dash cams are increasingly being deployed by police in the aftermath of high-profile shootings in recent years. They're designed to record police actions to protect cops from false allegations, and they're also used for public accountability purposes. In this instance, the video prompted a legal settlement. At the same time, however, police said the video showed the officer was not out of line.

"The body camera footage was indispensable in securing justice for Darsean Kelley," John M. Krieger, a spokesman with the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, told Ars. "Without irrefutable evidence of police misconduct captured on video, it would have been our client's word against multiple officers, and the truth about what happened to Darsean would almost certainly have never come to light."

The ACLU eventually convinced the authorities to drop the charges against Kelley. Its lawyers argued that their client was illegally detained when he was outside with his cousin. All the while, the Aurora Police Department has ruled the tasing as acceptable within department policy. The city said it was settling the legal claim (PDF) before a lawsuit was filed to avoid the expense of litigation.

Aurora City Attorney Mike Hyman said in a statement that the city settled so it wouldn’t have to spend even more taxpayer money defending a lawsuit.

"We disagree with the ACLU's characterization of the events in this case and their unwarranted attack against the Aurora Police Department," Hyman said Thursday. "This case was settled for the reason that many cases are settled—to avoid the cost of prolonged litigation. That cost would have far exceeded the value of the settlement."

The police department's internal review board cleared the cops of wrongdoing in October, concluding that the use of force "was reasonable, appropriate, and within policy." The officer who deployed the electronic device believed Kelley was reaching for a weapon.

When officers arrived in the area of the call they found an agitated Kelley yelling at another man and lawfully stopped him. After failing to obey numerous orders, Mr. Kelley was tased and subsequently arrested and charged in Aurora Municipal Court with ACC 94-110(5) Failure to Obey Lawful Orders.

The use of force applied against Mr. Kelley was later reviewed by the Force Review Board (FRB). The FRB is empaneled to review uses of force to determine compliance with Department Directives, procedures, and training. The FRB determined the force applied in this incident was within policy.

The ACLU said Kelley was not hospitalized. But in its claim for damages, the ACLU said that, because of the incident, Kelley has "developed a deep and lasting fear of the police."

Prosecutor: Martin Shkreli repeatedly lied to investors

Prosecutor: Martin Shkreli repeatedly lied to investors

NEW YORK (AP) — Wealthy investors say former biotech CEO Martin Shkreli told them he was managing tens of millions of dollars' worth of investments, that they were making double-digit returns and they could withdraw their money at any time.

Prosecutors in closing arguments Thursday at Shkreli's securities fraud trial said it was all a brazen con. The defense countered that no one should feel sorry for the alleged victims because they were high-rollers who ended up doubling or tripling their money.

Shkreli, 34, is best known for jacking up the price of a life-saving drug and trolling his critics on social media, but his trial in Brooklyn has focused on his time running a pair of hedge funds.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith told jurors Shkreli "lied to investors to get their money into the funds and then lied to them so they wouldn't take it out."

The prosecutor recounted testimony by investors who told jurors that Shkreli claimed to be managing up to $40 million in one of his firms at a time when its brokerage account held only a few hundred dollars. When one investor asked for his money back, Shkreli stalled for months until he used a Ponzi-like scheme to secretly raid a second fund to return a portion of the funds, she said.

"The defendant was lying not only about the ability to get a redemption, but also about where that money was coming from," she said.

As Shkreli was "blowing up" his hedge funds with bad stock picks, he continued to recruit new investors by portraying himself as a Wall Street whiz who graduated from Columbia University, Smith said. He really attended a lesser-known public university, Baruch College.

Claims "that he was some sort of genius in the investing industry were completely untrue," she said.

The defense has sought to portray the impish Shkreli as a misunderstood eccentric who slept on the floor of his office in a sleeping bag for two years while starting a successful drug company that allowed him to enrich his alleged victims.

"Who does that if you're committing a fraud and you have millions of dollars in people's money?" said his attorney, Ben Brafman. "He has no life. He's the hermit scientist."

Shkreli is "not a Ponzi guy who's taking money and buying a Cadillac or a yacht," the lawyer added at another point.

The lawyer agreed Shkreli could be annoying, saying, "In terms of people skills, he's impossible." But he claimed the clients who appeared as government witnesses were still eager to bet on him.

Investors "found him strange. They found him weird. And they gave him money. Why? Because they recognized genius," Brafman said.

Shkreli didn't testify, but throughout the trial he has used Facebook to bash prosecutors and news organizations covering his case, despite his lawyer's efforts to shut him up. In one recent post, he wrote, "This was a bogus case from day one."

The trial is in its fifth week. Jury deliberations could begin on Friday.

NEW YORK (AP) — Former pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli was portrayed both as a swindler by the government and as a well-meaning prodigy by his lawyers on the second day of closing arguments Friday at his securities fraud trial.

The trial in federal court in Brooklyn "has exposed Martin Shkreli for who he really is — a con man who stole millions," Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis told jurors.

Prosecutors allege that the 34-year-old Shkreli looted his drug company, Retrophin, of stock and cash so he could pay back disgruntled investors in a pair of failed hedge funds he ran. Investors testified that the defendant repeatedly lied to them about what was going on with their money.

The defense has argued that no one was victimized because Shkreli used his "genius" to make Retrophin a success and ensure investors doubled or even tripled their money.

"Who lost anything? Nobody," defense attorney Ben Brafman said in his closing argument. Some investors were forced to admit on the witness stand that partnering with Shkreli was "the greatest investment I've ever made," he added.

The lawyer also argued that a drug company official who testified for the government was biased. If Shkreli is found guilty of a felony, Brafman said, the company would have clear grounds for forcing him out as CEO in 2014 and would gain ammunition in its $65 million lawsuit against him. Shkreli claims he was wrongfully terminated and is owed millions.

With a guilty verdict, "Retrophin pops a Champagne cork," he said.

Shkreli became notorious for using another drug company to raise the price of a life-saving drug 5,000 percent and for trolling his critics on social media, where he's been dubbed "Pharma Bro."

The defendant didn't testify. But he made his thoughts on the case known on Facebook, where he called it "bogus."

The jury was expected to begin deliberating as soon as Friday afternoon.

This story has been corrected to show that the $65 million refers to damages sought in a lawsuit, not a $65 million stake in a drug company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    FOUNTAIN — Water providers and residents south of Colorado Springs chafed as the U.S. Air Force on Tuesday unveiled a nine-month study verifying that firefighting foam used at Peterson Air Force Base contaminated water and soil with toxic perfluorinated chemicals at levels more than 1,000 times higher than a national health advisory limit.

Air Force officials pledged to conduct further investigations that, sometime after 2019, may include analysis of human health risks. This initial investigation focused on contamination at the base. The spread of contaminants to where tens of thousands of people live remains a mystery, the officials said.

Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment leaders have said the state was waiting on the Air Force for information on how far and how fast PFCs have moved. El Paso County and CDPHE officials at a public meeting here Tuesday night said their agencies lack money to track the PFCs moving in groundwater at unknown concentrations south toward Pueblo.

“It makes me really angry that it has taken them this long to get some numbers — and more than a little concerned,” said Fountain City Council member Greg Lauer, who has been fielding calls from anxious residents for a year. “We and our ratepayers are going to be dealing for a very long time with this problem we did not create.”

Security Water and Sanitation District manager Roy Heald said his agency spent $3.6 million on pipelines and purchases of alternative clean water supplies after municipal wells were contaminated but has yet to receive a promised $800,000 in reimbursements from the Air Force.

“Our need is immediate. It is financial. And we need to get back to being able to use our well water,” Heald said.

“PFCs are found widely in the environment today, and there are likely other contributors to the contamination,” the report summary says. “As we continue our work with the public water suppliers in the Fountain, Widefield and Security area, we will study remediation steps, as other potential contributors are investigated.”

Air Force engineers in October began investigating to determine sources of the PFCs that state and local water tests had shown to be spreading from the base, including an area where firefighters trained. PFCs have been linked to health harm — low birth weights and kidney and testicular cancers — but public health epidemiological work in Colorado has not been done. A senior Pentagon official announced that the Air Force would spend $2 billion on PFC cleanups nationwide.

The EPA in May 2016 set a health advisory limit for two types of PFCs at 70 ppt based on the latest scientific studies of what could be harmful to people and the planet.

Air Force engineers investigating at Peterson found that PFCs from firefighting foam also had contaminated irrigation ponds at a golf course at high levels. “A complete human exposure pathway exists for golfers and golf course maintenance personnel exposed to surface water,” the report says.

The U.S. government does not regulate PFCs, which also are used to make products such as stain-proof carpet, nonstick cookware and grease-resistant fast-food wrappers.

Air Force Civil Engineering Center team leader Cornell Long said military funding for environment work on this problem is secure for now. An expanded site investigation to be completed next year may include data about concentrations of PFCs beyond the base. Long also said the Air Force will honor its commitments to reimburse communities south of Colorado Springs with a total of $4.3 million.

“This is an Air Force-wide issue. As good stewards of the environment, and wanting to do the right thing for communities, it is important that we continue to work at this,” he said. “There is still more work to be done.”

The contamination levels documents in Colorado “are very similar” to levels found at other air bases around the nation and abroad, he said. “What makes it difficult here is the wide range of contamination we are seeing on the base — and the information we do not have on how the contamination might move.”

A CDPHE website shows the contaminants have spread south beyond Widefield, Security and Fountain through the Fountain Creek watershed. In April 2016, groundwater samples taken south of Fountain along Hanover Road showed PFC contamination higher than 100 ppt.

State tests for PFCs in drinking water have not been done since November, CDPHE records show. And the CDPHE hasn’t measured PFCs in groundwater since February, the records show.

On Tuesday, Tyson Ingels, CDPHE’s lead drinking-water engineer, said agency officials “are not doing any tests now. We don’t have the funds to pay for any testing.”

El Paso County health spokeswoman Danielle Oller said the county also lacks funding to track PFC contamination, but that private well owners wanting tests will be referred to the Air Force for possible help.

“They need to be testing the water,” local farmer Susan Gordon said, adding that a filter provided by the Air Force may be losing its effectiveness.

Gordon and scores of other residents of Fountain, Security and Widefield have turned to buying bottled water.

“It is a major frustration,” said Deborah Stout-Meininger, 63, a resident of Fountain for 20 years, who supplements her Social Security income with work at a truck stop but finds the $40 a month extra she pays for water a burden.

“And I get really paranoid now,” she said. “I worry about whether the I am drinking safe water or not.”

'People fear what they don't understand': Culture clash with immigrants divides Pa. town

CALIFORNIA, Pa. -- Almost overnight they arrived, close to 100 Romanian immigrants who are members of a minority group called Roma, to take up residence in this small town along the Monongahela River.

If you've heard of California, it's probably because of the university. That's at one end of town, with brick buildings and bright colors. The rest of the town is filled with homes and businesses that are more time-worn, many of them built to house steelworkers and coal miners before those industries evaporated. Now they are home to their children, and grandchildren.

With a population of just about 6,700, it's a place where everyone knows everyone. But the presence of the newcomers, who arrived in May, seems to be tearing apart the bonds that have been built over generations.

"This is turning lifelong friends against each other," said Rebecca Daniels, who has lived in California her entire life. "I don't know if this can be fixed."

Immigrants took up residence in vacant, off-campus student housing -- particularly one rustic-looking apartment building where this week small, dark-haired children ran and played. Men in crisp polo shirts or clean, white button downs sat around tables and talked and smoked. Women, in long dresses, some wearing traditional Muslim head dressings, did the same, huddled on a long, splintered porch, apart from the men.

Some in California, many descended from immigrants, say they want to welcome their new neighbors and help them become a part of the community.

But others say the Roma -- sometimes referred to as gypsies --are different than the Italian Americans who came to town a handful of generations ago. Neighbors say - and loudly proclaimed at a recent borough council meeting - that the Roma refuse to assimilate, or even communicate, and have been wreaking havoc since their unexpected arrival.

They tell stories of Roma butchering chickens and defecating in public. Those stories recently gained attention when they were repeated on national television by Tucker Carlson, host of Fox News show "Tucker Carlson Tonight."

It's difficult to tell how and when this group of Roma got to the United States, but officials with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement say there are 97 of them living in California.

They are here unlawfully, officials say, and are part of ICE's Alternative to Detention Program, which allows them to remain in the community as they await court hearings and final orders to stay or to be deported back to Romania.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services could not confirm that the Roma are seeking asylum since those applications are confidential, but one Roma who briefly spoke with PennLive said that is why they are here - seeking asylum from persecution in their home country, something these nomadic people have suffered across Europe for decades, even centuries.

She said her name is Dochia.

She appeared to be in her late 20s and drank Coca Cola out of a wine glass as she smoked a cigarette. She was surrounded by several older women and spoke on the condition that no photos would be taken. During the interview Wednesday evening, a half-dozen children ran around the yard, shouting and playing.

That's why she came to the United States, she said. For the children.

"In my country, no help for kids," Dochia said. "I want to make good life in America with kids."

When she mentioned her home country, an older woman sitting next to her chimed in.

"Romania criminal," she said.

California, on the other hand, is a much better place, Dochia said. It's kind and welcoming, she said. And safe.

"This city is good," Dochia said. "Good people in California."

And many in California want to help. But they are having trouble getting through not only a language barrier, but also the cultural barrier of a people who tend to keep to themselves.

It has been tough getting to know the Roma, say the locals, even those who say they still want to help.

"This is what we know is right in our hearts," said lifelong resident Rosemary Capanna.

A helping hand

When Capanna's grandparents came here from Italy, they were not welcomed at first. Many immigrants - Italian, eastern European - lived on the outskirts of town and were considered to be outsiders, she said.

But as the generations grew up together, they gradually accepted one another, becoming neighbors and friends. And Capanna's grandparents would likely be proud to know that she is now the town's Democratic candidate for mayor.

"They weren't refugees, but they faced something similar," Capanna said of her grandparents. "Assimilation does not happen overnight."

This week, she and attorney Lisa Buday, who spoke at a recent borough council meeting to ask her neighbors to be supportive of the Roma, agreed to talk about what has been going on in their town.

"I don't agree with lawlessness; however, we don't know who they are," Buday said about the Roma. The people of California need to start building relationships with the Roma, and learn more about them in order to create that bond of community, she said. That's what will help the community overcome the problems it's facing.

Buday thinks that many of those problems referred to by Tucker Carlson have been exaggerated.

An incident in which a chicken was killed happened early on and can be attributed to cultural differences, she said. And the public defecation? She said she understands that was a one-time thing, adding that it was simply a case involving a little boy who couldn't make it home in time.

She has had no problems with the Roma. Buday says "hello" when she sees them on the street, and she allows the children to come into her law firm's lobby to play with Oliver, the office cat.

"They're a community of people and we're trying to figure out how best to get to know them," Buday said.

She and Capanna are not sure why there has been such a public outcry against the Roma. They speculate that it's because the Roma are so visible, spending most evenings sitting on their porches.

"Maybe we should all sit on our porches and hang out," Buday said. "What they do is not all that removed from what our immigrant families did 50 years ago."

"From my perspective, people fear what they don't understand," Capanna said. "I don't know if it's fear or a lack of understanding."

Capanna loves her town and knows its residents can come around to accept their new neighbors.

It's also a town the Roma say they love. Dochia said she hopes she is granted asylum so her family can stay here, where she says the people have been kind.

"No problem with the American people," she said, motioning toward the yard where her children played. "Everything OK. See? Kids playing."

The problem, others in town say, is that the Roma have not returned the favor.

'Pure havoc'

Pam Duricic is another lifelong California resident, and earlier this month, she was a vocal part of the group that showed up at a borough council meeting. They had questions, and they wanted to report the problems they have seen.

Her neighbor, Teresa Dearinger, agreed, saying one day in May, the college students left for the summer, and all of a sudden, the Roma showed up.

"It was a shock to our community," Dearinger said.

The women say California is a quaint, family-oriented place. Dearinger moved here to raise her three children in this environment.

"We have always been a welcoming, open community," Duricic said. "We have a small university, a lot of diversity. The crime rate is next to nothing, normally. We never had any problems. Until now."

Since she spoke out at the borough council meeting, Duricic said she and her neighbors have been unfairly portrayed as closed minded and racist. That is not the case, she said, and the race of the Roma is not the issue at all.

"It's people who are not following our laws and rules," Dearinger said.

She and Duricic talked of cars speeding through the streets, traffic accidents, shoplifting attempts at Dollar General, trash strewn about yards. Some incidents they say they witnessed themselves; some they heard about from neighbors and friends.

Based on that, they believe the problems are greater than an isolated incident or two of a chicken being beheaded.

Rebecca Daniels' son took a video of some Roma slaughtering a chicken and a turkey in the Roma's yard.

And the defecation? That was more than just one child, Duricic added.

"These were not children. They were grown men, dropping their pants," she said.

Daniels said her son's car was also damaged by a Roma neighbor who sped backwards into it. The insurance company told her the car was rental from Florida - one that had been missing for solong the rental company stopped paying the insurance on it, she said.

There were numerous thefts, they say, including Dearinger's children's toys being stolen from her porch.

As the group was advised to do at the council meeting, they have been calling the police and documenting what they see, including an incident Tuesday night.

Duricic and Dearinger said a group of Roma men in an apartment building near their homes had been drinking all day. They got loud and boisterous and the children threw empty beer bottles into the street to watch them roll downhill.

When an argument broke out, one of the men struck one of the women, they say. Dearinger said she has since been subpoenaed by police to testify about this.

Police Chief Richard Encapera is the only officer authorized to speak to the media, and he was on vacation this week. Borough administrator Richard Martin would not talk to PennLive. Borough council president Patsy Alfano and Mayor Walter Weld Jr. did not return phone calls for comment.

That's part of the problem, from Duricic's perspective. She said she is getting few answers from her town officials, many of whom are lifelong friends. Even after the meeting, she walked away with just as many unanswered questions. How long will the Roma be here? Will the children go to school in California? Will they face the same penalties for breaking the law as the residents? Is ICE monitoring them?

She and some friends have tried to reach out to the Roma, saying hello, trying to start conversations. But the Roma don't respond and don't seem to want that, she said.

And in the meantime, among the locals, lifelong friendships have crumbled. She said there are people she has known her entire life who no longer speak to her. She receives nasty comments on Facebook.

"We all grew up in school together, attended town functions together, but now you are seeing that divide," she said. "Our small town that we all loved for years and chose to stay here and raise our children is no longer. It all went up in smoke."

A few blocks away, sitting on her porch with the other Roma women, Dochia said she was unaware of such problems in this town that has treated her so well.

When asked about the butchering of chickens, she explained the Roma are Muslim and chicken is a significant part of their diet since they do not eat pork. It was an isolated incident, she said.

That's where PennLive's conversation with Dochia was cut short by a dark-haired man with a heavy five o'clock shadow and a blue polo shirt.

"Our religion, no talk to women," the man said, walking up to the porch, cigarette in hand.

When asked if there was someone else who could talk, he said, walking away, "Come tomorrow. Guy come for you."

He and several other men said the same thing the day before. "Come tomorrow."

An attempt to speak to another group of Roma at a home next to California's only gas station ended similarly.

Using the Google Translate app, this PennLive reporter tried to speak to several men sitting around a table, smoking cigarettes and drinking Mountain Dew. At the sight of the phone, a balding, older man dressed in white held up his hand and said "No pictures."

When he saw the translation and realized it was a request for an interview, he simply said, "Come tomorrow."

Some California residents say the self-imposed isolation of the Romas is the root of the problems. Others say it's simply a hurdle to overcome.

But mayoral candidate Rosemary Capanna said since folks in town heard about her efforts to reach out to this community, she has been getting private messages from some of the older residents.

"They remember this happening to them," Capanna said. She hopes an understanding can be reached soon for the sake of the town they all love. "In the end, we all live together here."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Richland County Sheriff's Department says three teens have been arrested in a crime spree that was escalating from a delivery robbery to armed robberies to a near sexual assault. And the victims were targeted because of their race, according to Sheriff Leon Lott.

"This was a crime spree. They would not have stopped," Lott said. "They made a statement that they did not like white people and they were only going to rob white people."

Lott says the two suspects, 17-year-old Raquan Green and a 15-year-old whose name has not been released, were arrested Wednesday. The third suspect, a 15-year-old boy, was taken into custody at his home on Walcott Street. Lott says the trio used racism to pick their victims.

The third suspect resisted arrest and injured an RSCD investigator in the process. The investigator had to be hospitalized with a leg injury and is expected to be OK. The suspect is now being charged with assault on a police officer while resisting arrest. Sheriff Lott says that should the investigator require surgery or an extensive hospital stay, charges may be upgraded.

"Between July 3 and July 26 there have been seven separate incidents of armed robberies, some to include carjacking and kidnapping along the Bluff /Shop Road Corridor," Lott said. "Investigators discovered that the suspects began targeting delivery drivers by committing armed robberies. The crimes then escalated to carjacking and kidnapping victims."

The crime spree started on July 3 when a food delivery driver was robbed. Two more incidents of food delivery robberies happened on July 15 and July 17. On July 19, a food delivery driver was robbed and forced to drive to an ATM and withdraw money.

All the incidents happened late at night where delivery drivers were targeted and students were moving into student housing or leaving apartments in the area. The suspects stole cash, cell phones, and various electronics.

07/25 -2:00 a.m. the victim was robbed, carjacked and kidnapped at Stadium Suites (Involved third suspect)

7/26 -1:15 a.m. the victim was robbed and kidnapped at 1050 Southern Drive, (Village at Columbia Apartments) (Involved the third suspect)

Lott says one of the victims, who was African American, was released from the suspects when they found out she was not white.

Green appeared in court and was given $40,000 bond. He is still housed at the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center as of Thursday evening.

Jordan, the only victim who spoke at the press conference, said she was returning home to her apartment at The Village Apartments on Southern Drive from work on July 26 around 12:15 a.m. when a group of three black males pushed her to the ground and placed a gun to her head.

The report says the men threatened to kill her unless she drove them to a nearby ATM. She complied, the report said, and withdrew $300 from her account.

It was at that point, according to the incident report, one of the men told the victim she was going to be used for sex at his "auntie's" house, but the victim found a way to escape by jumping out of her moving vehicle on Blair Road.

Deputies responded to the scene and located the victim's empty car. The K9 unit was brought out to search for the suspects, but they were not found.

Another similar incident happened at Stadium Suites where a 20-year-old victim said he and his roommate were returning home one night this past weekend when they were approached by three males with guns. The two were then driven to an ATM at gunpoint and asked to provide $500. The victim says the suspects were only able to obtain $600 before abandoning the two in a nearby parking lot.

A different student who lives at Oaks 21 Apartments, said she believes she came close to something similar when a stranger attempted to open her car door while she was sitting inside.

A statement released via a spokesperson from Stadium Suites' parent company, JMG Realty, says are extremely concerned about these recent crimes.

"We are cooperating fully with authorities, and have informed our residents via email and through our resident portal, of the recent crimes that have been reported to us," the statement said. "We will continue to keep our residents informed as we learn of developments or warnings from the local authorities. The safety and welfare of our residents are our top priority."

The University of South Carolina has released a statement, saying:

We are grateful to the Richland County Sheriff’s Department for their efforts to investigate these off-campus incidents and bring those responsible to justice. We have a strong partnership with RCSD and are appreciative of their longstanding support of USC and our students.

As always, we want to remind students to travel in pairs or small groups late at night, avoid dark or poorly lit areas, download the RAVE Guardian safety app on their phone and if they ever feel threatened, call 9-1-1 immediately.

Dentures left at scene lead to Tennessee man's rape conviction 16 years later

A 67-year-old man who previously served prison time in the murder of a 6-year-old child, pleaded guilty to a 2001 rape after investigators linked him to the scene of that crime through a pair of dentures he left behind.

The dentures were part of a sex assault kit backlog that wasn't tested until recently, though authorities may have been able to identify Thomas Maupin sooner -- his name was printed on the inside of the false teeth.

Maupin was sentenced to eight years in prison for raping the 31-year-old woman in Memphis in August 2001, FOX 13 Memphis reported.

At the time, police said the victim was approached by a motorist who got out of his car and started walking to her. A pair of dentures recovered at the scene were collected and tagged by investigators as part of the sexual assault kit.

The kit was later placed in the police property room, but became part of a backlog that was not tested until July 2016, WREG reported.

Officials from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation were able to eventually match the dentures to a partial DNA profile of Maupin -- and also discovered his name printed inside.

The dentures were originally made while Maupin served time in Washington state for the 1988 murder of a 6-year-old girl. He was twice convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison, but the convictions were overturned on appeal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        NASA scientists will chase solar eclipse in jets

Scientists will follow the shadow of the moon in two retrofitted WB-57F jet planes

For armchair astronomers and nearly everyone else watching the skies during the total solar eclipse Aug. 21, it will all be over in 2½ minutes.

But a team of NASA-funded scientists chasing the moon's shadow in retrofitted WB-57F jet planes will experience the rare phenomenon for more than seven extraordinary minutes.

A team led by Amir Caspi of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., will follow the darkness of the eclipse across the United States in two of NASA's research jets. The planes will take off from Houston and cross over Missouri, Illinois and Tennessee.

Mounted on the noses of both planes will be telescopes aimed to capture the clearest images taken to date of the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona.

"These could well turn out to be the best ever observations of high frequency phenomena in the corona," Dan Seaton, co-investigator of the project and researcher at the University of Colorado in Boulder, said in a written statement.

"Extending the observing time and going to very high altitude might allow us to see a few events or track waves that would be essentially invisible in just two minutes of observations from the ground."

Rare opportunity

During a total solar eclipse, the moon completely blocks the sun, allowing the sun's corona to be seen in stark contrast to the surrounding darkness.

Scientists hope to untangle some of the mystery around why the outer layers of the sun's atmosphere are actually hotter than the layers closer to the sun.

Micro explosions on the sun's surface — known as nanoflares — could play a part in this puzzling phenomenon, and the eclipse offers a rare opportunity to observe them.

At the same time, the team expects to get thermal images of Mercury to find out how temperatures vary across the surface of the planet closest to the sun.

NASA is funding 11 projects that will allow scientists to use the eclipse to learn about the sun and its relationship to the Earth's upper atmosphere.

The US embassy has been told to cut its staffing levels

Russia has retaliated to new US sanctions by telling Washington to cut its diplomatic staff to 455 and barring the use of some properties.

The new US embassy staffing level would be the same as at Russia's embassy in Washington.

The Russian foreign ministry also said it was seizing holiday properties and a warehouse used by US diplomats.

The new US sanctions are over Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and alleged interference in the US election.

They come months after the Obama administration ordered the seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in response to alleged hacking of the US Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign.

In a statement on Friday, Russia's foreign ministry said: "The US is stubbornly taking one crudely anti-Russian step after another, using the utterly fictitious pretext of Russian interference in its internal affairs."

The US expulsion of Russian diplomats "clearly violates the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations and generally accepted diplomatic norms", it added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A TEXAS teen who ran into a church half-naked saying she was raped was indicted for what turned out to be an elaborate hoax.

Breana Harmon, 19, was charged on Wednesday with two counts of tampering with physical evidence and two counts of tampering with a government record, which are felonies, according to the Herald Democrat.

Officials said that teen, who also uses the last name Talbott, made a false report to police on March 8 claiming to have been abducted and gang-raped behind a church in Denison, Texas.

The teen turned up at the local church covered in blood and wearing only a shirt, bra and underwear. She allegedly told parishioners that black men had taken her into the woods and raped her.

Harmon, then 18, told police that she was raped by two black men in ski masks while a third pinned her down. She claimed that the suspects had kidnapped her near her car in an apartment parking lot, news station KXII reported.

Police discovered her car with a door open and her phone, keys and shoe scattered on the ground.

Harmon was brought to a nearby hospital for examination, where physicians determined she had not suffered any injuries consistent with her claims, according to police.

Authorities searched for further evidence, but were not able to corroborate Harmon’s story. Police also said the crime scene was “staged” and Harmon’s injuries were “self-inflicted.”

When investigators confronted Harmon, she admitted that the allegations were false. It is not known what prompted her to report the hoax.

She was arrested in March for the misdemeanour offence of false report to a police officer, but officials decided to seek more charges.

“The more we have looked at what happened in this case, and considered the harm it caused, and certainly could have caused, we believe what she did fits the elements of these higher charges,” Grayson County District Attorney Joe Brown said in a statement.

“What she did was very serious, and we believe it was felony conduct.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Weather Forecast

Woman who threatened to 'kill all of ya' Somali Americans will be fired

FARGO — A white woman from Mapleton, N.D., who was recorded Tuesday, July 25, threatening a group of three Muslim women in the Walmart parking lot on 13th Avenue South, telling them to "go home" and that she would kill them, will lose her job.

“Whenever she gets here, she will be let go.” said a person at Fargo accounting firm Horab and Wentz, who would only identify himself as one of the firm's partners on Wednesday, July 26.

The man said of Amber Elizabeth Hensley: “Her views are not ours." A couple phones could be heard ringing in the background.

She was in the car with her sister, Leyla Hassan, 20, and their friend, 23-year-old Rowda Soyan. All three women live in Fargo and are originally from Somalia. They were shopping at Walmart Tuesday afternoon before going to the movie theater when they parked next to the woman.

Hensley, whose Twitter account expresses support for President Trump, commented on Facebook about the video, identifying herself and apologizing to the women.

"It was not a Christian like thing to do AT ALL and wish I could take it back, but I lost my cool and I can't. I am terribly sorry," Hensley wrote in her post. "I just wish that the whole video could be shown. And the things that were stated before she starts taping. She had parked way too close to my car and I couldn't get in, when I asked her to move she refused, I asked her again and she swore at me calling me a fat b-tch."

"But there are absolutely no excuses. I am in tears with regret and will take any form of punishment deemed fit."

Sarah Hassan said she started recording when she realized they needed evidence of the woman's "unacceptable" behavior. They called police around 5:30 p.m. and showed officers the video and the woman's license plate number as they filed a report.

Officers did not return phone calls Tuesday evening.

The women shared their concerns and the video with Hukun Dabar, executive director of Afro American Development Association, a Moorhead nonprofit. Dabar then shared the video on Facebook

Within two hours of posting the video Tuesday night, it was shared more than 530 times.

"What makes me sad is you don't see any leaders from Fargo confronting this issue and saying it's not acceptable in our community," he said. "They need to speak about this issue and have it be at the forefront."

Fargo-Moorhead is supposed to be a "welcoming city," Dabar said, but "when they don't talk about this issue it shows something else."

Dabar also called out the inaction of bystanders at Walmart who didn't defend the women or say anything to Hensley. He tied this incident to a recent case of discrimination in Moorhead.

A Somali-American man was assaulted while moving into an apartment on July 2 by two white men from the area who said, "What are these n---- doing here?" at the time of the attack, according to eyewitnesses.

Police arrested the men, James Patrick Billiot and Justin William Rifanburg, who were charged with simple assault, a misdemeanor. CAIR, a Muslim civil rights group in Minnesota, urged state and federal law enforcement officials to investigate what they called a "possible hate crime."

"It's happening again," Dabar said in reference to the two instances of discrimination in the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Jarvis' wife, Petra, was a new patient of Graham and had an appointment on Wednesday, officials said. The doctor at the appointment informed Jarvis and his wife that, even though she suffered from pain, he would not prescribe the opioid.

"He did what we ask our doctors to do," St. Joseph County Prosecutor Ken Cotter said at a news conference. "Don't over-prescribe opioids."

Dr. Todd Graham

Graham had declined to prescribe Petra Jarvis the medication during a 10:45 a.m. appointment Wednesday. At around 1 p.m., Michael Jarvis returned to the medical complex off of Elm Road near Mishawaka, without his wife or her knowledge, and ambushed Graham, a physician with South Bend Orthopedics, police said.

After a brief argument in the parking lot, Michael Jarvis told two witnesses to leave the scene before shooting Graham twice in the head.

Jarvis then drove away in a red Dodge Neon to a friend's home at the corner of Dragoon Trail and Valley Trail, about three miles away, and "gave them indication that he was not going to be around," Cotter said.

The friend called police, who shortly later found Jarvis dead outside the home from two self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

Cotter said Michael Jarvis was not a patient of Graham's.

"Make no mistake, this is a person who made a choice to kill Dr. Graham," Cotter said. "This is not a fallout from the opioid epidemic or any opioid problems. That probably leads us into an examination of what is happening with the opioid problem in our community, and frankly, our whole nation."

Metro Homicide Commander Tim Corbett said people inside the buildings at the medical complex were fortunate.

"If Jarvis would have gotten inside that building, although there would have been a specific target, it's like trapping an animal in a corner, they're going to come out fighting, and I truly believe this could have escalated into a mass shooting," Corbett said.

Cotter said he's received calls from doctors since the tragedy and he is trying to start a dialogue with the medical community about how to prevent such incidents in the future.

"This is a clear indication that it's not just a doctor issue, it's not just a law enforcement issue, it's our whole community's issue," Cotter said.

The red Neon was still parked in the driveway of Michael Jarvis' friend's home Thursday. A Notre Dame staff parking tag hung from the rearview mirror, and the backseat contained a cooler with "JARVIS" written on it.

University spokesman Paul Brown said in a statement, "Notre Dame has an employee on its books identified as Michael Jarvis as an on-call, part-time parking attendant and groundskeeper."

The statement also said that Graham "served as a consulting physician at Notre Dame. His brutal death is shocking to us all, we extend our condolences to his family and friends. Our prayers are with them."

Police are urging anyone who saw the girls around the time of the attacks to come forward

A girl of 15 was raped at a train station in Birmingham before being sexually assaulted by the driver of a car she flagged down to help her.

Detectives called the two attacks at Witton station "horrifying" and said they were launching a major manhunt.

The teenager was with a friend when she was approached by a man who led her to a secluded part of the station and raped her.

Shortly after she flagged down a passing car and was assaulted again.

British Transport Police and West Midlands Police are treating it as two separate reports of rape.

The first attacker is described by police as an Asian man in his early 20s with light skin, brown eyes, skinny build and about 6ft tall.

Police said the second man was also Asian and in his early 20s and about 5ft 6in to 5ft 7in tall. He was of a large build, with a beard and wore a blue jumper and black jeans.

The attacks happened between 19:00 BST on Tuesday and 02:00 on Wednesday.

CCTV has been seized and is being investigated.

'Awful incidents'

Det Ch Insp Tony Fitzpatrick said: "This was a horrifying ordeal for this young girl and we have specially trained officers supporting her.

"It is now vitally important we investigate exactly what happened on Wednesday morning as well as identifying offenders for both of these awful incidents.

"I would be keen to speak with anyone who may have been in the area at the time. If you were passing by the station and saw two girls walking with an older man, then please get in touch immediately.

"Likewise, if you saw any suspicious vehicles close to Witton station close to 2am then please get in touch as soon as possible. Your information could prove vital in our enquiries to identify the perpetrators."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    LOS ANGELES -- USC football coach Clay Helton said former Heisman Trophy-winning running back O.J. Simpson would not be welcome on campus after he is released from prison in October.

"Right now with USC, what the administration and the athletic department have said is, no, O.J. will not be a part of our functions," Helton said when asked whether Simpson would be welcome to attend a practice. "That's been the statement."

Simpson was granted parole last week in Nevada after more than eight years in prison there since being convicted in 2008 of an armed robbery involving two sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel room. The 70-year-old Simpson could be out of prison as early as Oct. 1 after serving the minimum nine years of a 33-year sentence.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's sudden decision to ban transgender personnel from serving in the military has alarmed some senior military officers who were caught off guard by it.

Trump's declaration, which came via early morning tweets on Wednesday, appeared to pre-empt an ongoing Pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military, and he drew criticism from three senior officers interviewed by Reuters on Thursday.

"I hope our commander in chief understands that we don't transmit orders via Twitter, and that he can't, either," one said by telephone, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

"Even if this were an order, implementing it legally would take considerable time, if it's even possible."

Rights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused Trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active-duty service members and reservists, who say they number in the thousands..

The United States' top military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, told the armed forces on Thursday there had been no change yet to Pentagon policy on transgender personnel.

Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged the uncertainty that followed Trump's announcement in a note to service chiefs, commanders and senior enlisted leaders.

"I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement on the transgender policy by the President," Dunford wrote.

"There will be no modifications to the current policy until the President's direction has been received by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary has issued implementation guidance," Dunford said in the message, first reported by Reuters.

Dunford then made the assurance that the military would "treat all of our personnel with respect."

His message neither voiced support nor opposition to Trump's decision.

One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Dunford in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force acknowledged that Trump's announcement on Wednesday was "unexpected."

The Defense Department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year. But Mattis on June 30 approved a six-month delay to allow for a review.

As a presidential candidate, Trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.

His move on Wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow Republicans.

The White House said Trump had "extensive discussions with his national security team," and that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was informed after the president decided on Tuesday to go ahead.

Trump cited "tremendous medical costs and disruption" as a justification for the ban, a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individual's capabilities, not gender identity or sexual preference.

The Army's chief of staff, General Mark Milley, said on Thursday that there had been issues with transgender individuals serving in the Army.

"I will be candid. ... This is a complex issue and there (are) a variety of challenges out there that we have to deal with and we have been working through it, but this is not clean-cut either way," he said.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said implementation of Trump's decision was still being worked out.

Separately, the Trump administration on Thursday told a U.S. appeals court in New York that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position Democratic former President Barack Obama took.

Trump's plan to ban transgender military service members has unleashed legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue.

Trump's tweets did not make clear when a ban would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join.

But if the Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight, legal experts say.

"There's no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military," said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal.

It was also unclear whether it might go beyond active-duty forces and apply to reservists.

'Breaks Your Spirit'

Indiana National Guard reservist Cameron St. Andrew, who resigned from full-time service after the November election, told Reuters that as a transgender person he was concerned about his status.

"I try to be tough about it," he said, but added: "It breaks your spirit down."

One active-duty U.S. military officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said senior officials were not consulted.

"We're scratching our heads and asking where the hell this came from," the officer said by phone.

"Maybe the president is in step with some members of Congress and some voters, but he is out of step with today’s military. Our service personnel today don’t give a damn about the personal lives of their comrades so long as they know they can trust them when it counts."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        It is a command that led the leading atheist Richard Dawkins to claim that the God of the Old Testament was “a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser … a genocidal … megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully”.

For God had ordered the Israelites to slaughter the apparently sinful Canaanites, saying: “You shall not leave alive anything that breathes. But you shall utterly destroy them.” And, according to the Bible, they did just that.

However, a new genetic study has found that the Canaanites actually managed to survive this purge of their traditional homeland, passing on their DNA over the centuries to their numerous descendants in modern-day Lebanon.

“The Bible reports the destruction of the Canaanite cities and the annihilation of its people; if true, the Canaanites could not have directly contributed genetically to present-day populations,” the researchers wrote.

“However, no archaeological evidence has so far been found to support widespread destruction of Canaanite cities between the Bronze and Iron Ages: cities on the Levant coast such as Sidon and Tyre show continuity of occupation until the present day.

“We show that present-day Lebanese derive most of their ancestry from a Canaanite-related population, which therefore implies substantial genetic continuity in the Levant since at least the Bronze Age.”

The degree of genetic closeness between the ancient Canaanites and modern Lebanese people was something of a surprise as the area was repeatedly fought over and conquered by various different groups throughout history, although some of them did leave genetic traces that survive to this day.

One of the researchers, Dr Marc Haber, of The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said: "The present-day Lebanese are likely to be direct descendants of the Canaanites, but they have in addition a small proportion of Eurasian ancestry that may have arrived via conquests by distant populations such as the Assyrians, Persians, or Macedonians.”

He added that it had been a “pleasant surprise” to be able to extract and analyse DNA from human remains that were nearly 4,000 years old, particularly as they were found in a hot environment.

The Canaanites are roundly condemned in the Old Testament – they were the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, two cities destroyed with fire and brimstone directly by God, according to the Book of Genesis.

While the Bible says they were wiped out by the Israelites under Joshua in the land of Canaan, later passages suggest there were at least a few survivors. Some Biblical scholars have argued the passages are hyperbole, but the genetic research would appear to indicate the slaughter was much less extensive than described.

Also known as the Phoenicians, the Canaanites proved to be great seafaring traders and established colonies across the Mediterranean.

They are also credited with inventing the first alphabet, although ironically few written records have survived the passage of time, so accounts describing them largely come from enemies and rivals, such as the Israelites, Egyptians and Greeks.

The researchers said they hoped genetic techniques could help shed more light on the region’s history.

Dr Claude Doumet-Serhal, a co-author of the paper and director of the Sidon excavation site in Lebanon, said: “For the first time we have genetic evidence for substantial continuity in the region, from the Bronze Age Canaanite population through to the present day.

“These results agree with the continuity seen by archaeologists. Collaborations between archaeologists and geneticists greatly enrich both fields of study and can answer questions about ancestry in ways that experts in neither field can answer alone.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    For four years, Ashley Gonzalez skimped on sleep, family outings and hanging out with friends to excel at John Marshall High School in Los Angeles. Her work paid off when she achieved her lifelong dream of admission to the University of California.

Then UC Irvine, her campus of choice, abruptly rescinded its acceptance, just two months before the start of the fall quarter.

“I felt I was going to pass out. I couldn’t stop crying,” the 18-year-old said in tears as she recounted her story in an interview.

UCI’s stated reason for the rescission, Gonzalez said, was that the campus had not received one of two required transcripts on time — though she and her mother say they mailed out both documents in the same envelope two weeks before the July 1 deadline.

Gonzalez, who has filed an appeal, is one of 499 UCI students whose offers of admission have been withdrawn for this fall — 290 of them for transcript issues and the rest for poor senior year grades, according to campus data.

The withdrawals have kicked up a storm of protest on social media, with scores of students expressing outrage and pleading for help on Twitter, Reddit and the UC Irvine Class of 2021 Facebook page. Many insist the rescission notices cited reasons either minor or bogus or gave no reason at all. They speculate that the campus simply was coming up with excuses to solve a problem after more students than expected said they planned to attend.

“UCI overenrolled freshmen so they might be withdrawing admissions on purpose to kick as many students out,” said Emily Roche, 18, who was told her acceptance was canceled because her transcript had not arrived on time.

One widely discussed Reddit post by someone using the name UCIrvineCompany, who claimed be “in touch with the Office of Admissions,” said about 800 more students than expected accepted UCI’s admission offers.

Thomas A. Parham, vice chancellor of student affairs, conceded Friday that UCI was more stringent than usual in checking requirements this year, and he apologized for the distress caused. He urged those who felt they had been treated unfairly to file appeals, and said all accepted students who met the admission conditions would be allowed to attend.

“I acknowledge that we took a harder line on the terms and conditions this year and we could have managed that process with greater care, sensitivity and clarity about available options,” he said in a message sent to all students whose admissions were revoked. “For those who felt ignored or mistreated, I sincerely apologize.”

Brent Yunek, associate vice chancellor of enrollment services, confirmed that more students signed formal statements of intent to register than anticipated – the share of California freshmen who did so, for instance, rose to 26.4% from 24.6% last year, he said.

Overall, about 7,100 of the 31,103 freshmen offered admission to UC Irvine for this fall accepted it as of May, according to the UC Office of the President. That amounts to 850 more students than UC Irvine’s planned freshman class of 6,250, though some are expected to decide to enroll elsewhere this fall in what is known as “summer melt.” Still, in the last two years, the summer drop-off has been only about 250.

Yunek reiterated that UCI was not looking for ways to squeeze students out.

“Of course we’re not revoking enrollments or admission for bogus reasons,” he said. “We’re very sensitive and considerate to families. We’re only withdrawing admission where students have not satisfied conditions” of their freshman admission contracts.

Those conditions include receiving a high school diploma, maintaining a weighted 3.0 senior-year GPA with no Ds or Fs in UC-approved courses and meeting deadlines for submitting all official high school and college transcripts and test scores.

Yunek, associate vice chancellor of enrollment services, said data for previous years were not immediately available so he could not say whether this year’s rescissions were unusually high. All colleges and universities set conditions that admitted students must meet or face rescissions — one reason schools warn against “senioritis” — and UC campuses vary widely in their cancellations. UCLA revoked seven freshman offers this year and UC San Diego nine. UC Davis has yet to send out recission notices this year but has averaged about 150 in each of the past two years, a spokeswoman said.

At UC Irvine, admissions officials worked hard to process appeals quickly, Yunek said — and 63 of 295 students who filed them have had their acceptances reinstated so far.

“In any case where we’ve identified administrative errors on our part, we’re correcting them,” Yunek said. “The guiding principle we’re using now is that we’re trying not to hold students accountable for situations out of their control.”

The executive cabinet of the Associated Students of UC Irvine has rallied behind the students, demanding that officials apologize for any admission errors, provide clear explanations for each rescission, return all related payments and establish a special process for those formerly accepted students who will now wind up at community colleges to transfer to UC Irvine after two years.

A petition stating these demands had been signed by more than 640 students, relatives, alumni and community members as of Thursday afternoon.

“We are so sorry that UCI admin has decided to ruin students lives...They NEED to be held accountable for their actions, and they need to know that we will not just sit back and allow them to take advantage of students,” a separate student body statement said.

In his apology Friday, Parham said he has directed the admissions team to step up personal outreach to all students notified of rescissions and has added staff to review appeals and answer phones — noting that an outdated telephone system had contributed to delays.

“We are committed to correcting any errors swiftly and providing the help you need in an empathetic and understanding way,” he said.

Roche, who graduated this spring with a 4.11 GPA from William S. Hart High School in Newhall, said she learned of her rescission only after seeing the uproar on Facebook and checking her UC Irvine online portal last week. When an admissions officer subsequently told her the campus never received her high school transcript, she got a note from the high school registrar saying that the transcript had been sent on June 20 and appealed the rescission.

Another student said a campus official told him that he had violated a freshman admission requirement but could not tell him which one. He asked to be identified only by his first name, Carson, to avoid jeopardizing future admissions prospects.

“They’re pretty much leaving us in the dark,” said the 22-year-old, who had planned to major in neurobiology after completing four years with the U.S. Marine Corps. “They seem like a monolithic bureaucracy and students are completely powerless. When I talk to them, it’s like talking to a wall.”

He said he turned down an offer from UC San Diego and a $30,000 scholarship from UC Santa Cruz in favor of UC Irvine, but those options are no longer available. He’s appealed his rescission but is also making plans to attend Irvine Valley College if it fails.

Allen Chung is one of the lucky ones whose appeal worked. The Loyola High School graduate said he was shocked to receive a rescission notice after he had signed up for orientation, applied for student housing and even bought furniture for his dorm room. After multiple calls to the admission office — recordings asking him to call back later and 90 minutes spent on hold — he said he finally was told that his transcript was missing a graduation date.

Loyola gave Chung a copy of his transcript, which he said always included the graduation date, along with evidence that it was sent on time and a letter of support from the principal. Chung drove to Irvine last week to deliver the documents personally. He was readmitted two days later.

“It was a huge weight off my back seeing my future revived,” he said.

Gonzalez, meanwhile, is still awaiting a decision. Her parents are Guatemalan immigrants who never attended high school and work as an auto technician and housekeeper. She said she has long seen the UC as her path to a better life and a bigger home for her family.

To try to get to UC Irvine, she earned a 4.0-plus weighted GPA in honors and Advanced Placement classes, mentored younger students and volunteered at an animal shelter and wellness foundation. She said she sometimes studied until 5 a.m. and missed every family party during her junior year.

When her acceptance was rescinded, she said, “I thought my future was over. I worked so hard. I felt it wasn’t fair.”

Asked what she would do if her appeal failed, she was silent as her eyes filled with tears.

A mother recently posted anonymously to a parenting group on Facebook to reveal she had used her breast milk in a batch of bake sale brownies at her children’s school, and that some moms weren’t thrilled about it.

“I didn’t have time to run to the store and didn’t think it was a big deal (some of those kids could use the nutrition let’s be honest). And it wasn’t even that much,” the mother wrote. “One of the other moms found out and are blowing it way out of proportion. Idk what to do! Any suggestions?”

The comments under the post ranged from anger, to admiration, to absolute hilarity.

Some accused her of putting their children’s health at risk, saying it was comparable to exposing them to any other bodily fluids, while others downplayed the incident with sarcastic quips.

Video footage showed the tank accelerate to meet the car as it raced towards the checkpoint.

The tank retreated as civilians ran for cover, at which point the car exploded and nearby civilians were caught in the blast.

An army spokesman said the attack could have killed 50-60 people had it reached its target.

“The explosion was large, carrying about 100kg of high explosives,” the statement said.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

An insurgency in Egypt's Sinai region has gained pace since the army toppled President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's oldest Islamist movement, following mass protests against his rule in mid-2013.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A 50-year-old German man has been killed and six people injured in a knife attack in a Hamburg supermarket, German police say.

Police said the suspect was 26 years old and born in the United Arab Emirates. They said he acted alone and he was overpowered by passersby.

It was too soon to pinpoint a motive, they tweeted.

There are unconfirmed reports that he shouted "Allahu akhbar", Arabic for "God is great" while attacking people.

Police said they were still seeking to confirm his current nationality.

The man attacked customers in the supermarket at random, ran outside and was chased by customers and by people outside the shop. They brought him to the ground before he was detained by plain-clothes police officers.

A 50-year-old woman and four men aged between 19 and 64 were stabbed, while a 35-year-old man was injured while helping overcome the suspect.

The attack happened in the Barmbek region in the north of the city in a branch of Edeka, Germany's largest supermarket chain.

Police say the man's weapon may have looked like a machete but they are, for now, assuming it was a kitchen knife.

One eyewitness made a gesture about 50cm (20 in) long when asked on German TV how big the knife was.

Asked whether this was a terror attack, a police official told the BBC: "We are at an early stage of the investigation... At the moment we can't rule anything out. We are investigating all avenues."

Speculation in German media said the attack may have been part of a robbery attempt but police said that that motive could not be confirmed.

One eyewitness, who ran from the scene into a nearby shop as the situation unfolded, told German broadcaster NTV that it seemed "hectic and confused, not like a properly planned attack".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Louis Tramunti’s Wife Thought He Was Having a Heart Attack. So Why Did the Police Break His Back?

He made it unscathed from Whitestone to Westchester. Then his wife called 911 and things fell apart, fast.

07.27.17 1:00 AM ET

When Louis Tramunti’s wife called 911, she wanted EMTs to save her husband’s life after a heart attack. Instead, two policemen threw him to the floor and broke his back. It was just one of those things; didn’t even make the papers.

Louis, an old friend of an old friend of mine, called me nearly a year later because “people need to know about this, bro,” which didn’t thrill his attorney.

“I’m not typically a PR lawyer,” said Steven Falkoff when I called. “It’s a basic fact pattern and excessive-force case. I don’t know how much sexiness there is for a broader story.”

To Louis—a good-natured if foul-mouthed 37-year-old Bernie-supporting son of Whitestone, a corner of Queens untouched by gentrification or even integration—it’s the only story.

He’s been married for seven years to Szilvia, a lovely Hungarian immigrant whose calmness evens out his off-the-walls hyperactivity, and he’s worked for more than 15 years as a plumbing surveyor, making good union wages mapping out where the sleeves go as new high-end Manhattan buildings rise up. Wherever Louis works now, he etches the name of their 2-year-old son, Marco, behind where the wall will be on each floor. The job puts him on top of half-finished buildings, Manhattan stretched out before him. Being up there, he says, is what made him fear thunder.

The family lives 40 miles and a world from Henry Hill or Archie Bunker’s Queens, in a split-level house in leafy Yorktown Heights, Westchester, just past the Donald J. Trump State Park (yes, no kidding; Trump donated the land in 2006) and down the road from the Elks Lodge. Before that, they lived for eight years in an apartment a few miles away in Hartsdale.

That’s where they were on April Fool’s Day 2016, a Saturday, as Szilvia drove her car into Greenburgh to have an officer do a safety check on the child seat, since Marco—a big kid, like his dad—had to start facing front. Went to dinner with them, put Marco to sleep, and went to bed herself.

Early Sunday morning, in the midst of a huge storm, the police came to them.

The thunder woke up Szilvia, and she heard a weird, loud groan and turned to shush Louis, who she figured was once again being some sort of goofy. She sees that he’s on his stomach shaking, sweating up a storm and drooling all over himself, not responding to her and still making the weird groan. So she called 911 (“for the first time in my life,” she later told The Daily Beast. “I’m a shy person”) and told the operator her husband’s having a heart attack.

She’s still on the line when the EMTs arrived, standing at the open front door of their apartment with Marco in her arms and a drop of blood on her shirt from a stress-induced nosebleed. The first responders saw her and then Louis, all 6 feet and 200 pounds of him, lurching in his underwear and walk away, telling the Greenburgh Police Officers en route to step on it.

Two officers get there and see Louis standing against a wall, eyes open but not responding to them. They approach, shine a light in his eyes, and just as he comes to and realizes they’re there, “I’m landing on my back and hitting my head at the same time.

“They had my arms pinned and their knees to my chest and they’re still shining the light in my eyes, and I’m just coming to and then they turn me around and squeeze my elbows together behind my back, and one of them has a knee in my back, and my legs go numb. I tell them I can’t breathe but the knee’s still there. I hear something crack and they crisscross my hands and cuff them and pull me up by the back and my chest starts killing me.

“They’re not saying anything to me, just dragging me out the door and Marco’s on the couch watching and someone’s saying to my wife ‘Don’t sugarcoat it, honey, we know he beat you up.’ And then I’m outside, in my fucking underwear, in the fucking snow, before all my neighbors.”

“Now, they’re talking to me: ‘We know you beat your wife.’”

“And I’m thinking: ‘Are you fucking kidding me’?”

The EMTs get outside and an officer comes with them and cuffs Louis inside the ambulance.

“This cop is telling me: ‘Yeah you beat your wife up. Is that the kind of man you are?’’

“I’m crying. I mean, I’ve never laid a hand on my wife. I had a great day. We had dinner and I played Call of Duty and fell asleep on the couch. Went into our bed and held my wife and fell back asleep. Wake up and there are the police taking me down—boom!—and telling me I beat my wife.

“I’m licking my lips and someone tells me to fucking stop so I do and I feel nauseous. Then tells me not to throw up, or it’s going to a big problem. They put a bag over my mouth.

“I’m crying. Is this who I am? Last thing I knew, I was falling asleep.

“I remember one of them saying we have a possible fifty-fifty-one or whatever and it seemed so odd. Later I realized that meant they were reporting they had a crazy or deranged person.

“So we get to the White Plains Hospital and I’m cuffed to the gurney, screaming the whole time that my ribs are killing me and that I can’t breathe. The cop from my house is there, trying to play the good-guy role and telling me, ‘Honestly, you know you really did beat up your wife tonight. You beat your wife good.’

“This doctor comes in and asks me questions and hears the way I’m staggering in my speech and right away wants to see if I had a seizure.

“Later, they put all the wiring in my head, and they told me I’d had a seizure. My first one. In fact, I had all the signs of one, bro, that the EMTs should have recognized. My wife didn’t say that when she called 911, because she’s not a doctor.

“Then they found I had four fractured vertebrae. I was in so much pain from my back and then on so much pain medication that I didn’t realize, and the doctors didn’t find until days later, that I’d also torn the tendon between my chest and my ribs.

That was long after “the cop, the same one who kept telling me I’d beaten my wife, finally took the cuffs off me.

“He said, ‘Sorry buddy. You’ll be OK.’ And then he left.”

No charges were filed.

Here’s how the night’s events come out in the colder, more cautious language of official reports. Remember everything that follows (and is sic’d throughout) is in response to Szilvia’s call to 911 saying her husband was having a heart attack:

Narrative: U/A find Pt on scene inside residence Awake and alert but non verbal standing up against the living room. Pt not responding to verbal stimuli or commands. Pt sweating, appears frightened and acting bizarre. Listed officer and Officer Maiden placed pt in restraints for pt’s safety and others on the scene. After pt was placed in cuffs he began responded to Officers. Pt reports he does not remeber getting out of bed and that the last thing he remembers wass going to sleep and then being in hand cuffs with Officers. Pt denies pain or discomfort. Pt placed on stretcher and into ambulance… Further als assessment waived in favor of patient being transported to the appropriate facility for a psych evaluation. While enroute the pt made statements like, “is this real”, as if parnoid.Pt care tansferred to stall.

Wife on scene reports her husband awoke from bed after a loud ligthing strike sound was heard outside during a storm. Pt would not listen to her and was roaming around the apartment as if he was terrified. Wife reports pt has never acted like this before and that he does not abuse drugs or alcohol. Wife reports pt was acting normal before going to bed the evening and that everything was normal.

From the police Incident/Investigation Report, about responding to “a possible ‘heart attack’”:

On approach to the residence, the Undersigned and PO Freeman observed a Greenville Fire Captain run out of the premise and state, “He is acting up in there, you better get in fast!”

On entering, the officers observed a middle aged man wearing only his boxers standing in the landing of the kitchen… (and) a white female and a young child standing in the livingroom. Both the child and the female appeared to be afraid. It should also be noted that the female was bleeding from the nose and had blood on her shirt and there were some blood droplets on the floor.

At this point, PO Freeman attempted to make vocal contact with the unknown male (later identified: as (PT) Tramunti, Louis) with negative result. The male only stared blankly at officers while sweating profusely and looking back and forth in an agitated state and obviously acting bizarre. At this time, PO Freeman and the undersigned, for the safety of the officers and all other people on the scene, decided to achieve control of the non-vocal and non-compliant PT by placing him in handcuffs and then placing him on the floor so that he could be properly assessed by PO Paramedic Freeman… The undersigned restrained PT’s legs in order to protect himself and officer freeman from being kicked during the assessment.

And from the supplemental report filed months later by the same officer, claiming that Louis “was awake and alert, sweating and appeared frightened” when the officers entered, It stresses that Szilvia and Marco, too, “appeared frightened” and that there was blood on her shirt and “droplets” on the floor:

Despite reporting that Louis was “awake and alert,” it continues: PT did not reply to verbal communication… was acting bizarre and appeared agitated. (PT stared blankly, back and forth at Officers as if confused. While on the floor in a supine position listed Officer assessed the (PT)’s vital signs… and obvious signs of trauma, which all appeared normal.

…

“When in the back of the ambulance (PT) came out of his trance like state and began asking what happened. … (PT) stated, “is this real” numerous times as if paranoid. (PT) kept asking what had happened after being told numerous times by listed Offiicer. (PT) did not complain of injury or pain other than discomfort from the hand cuffs that remained on him during the transport to the hospital.

Louis—who spent six weeks recovering before going back to work—and Szilvia are suing after rejecting a settlement offer.

Asked about the suit, Greenburgh Police Chief Chris McNerney emailed: “We are committed to vigorously defending yet another frivolous lawsuit against a police department. We are looking forward to the facts being presented in a court of law, as there is not one credible piece of evidence to support this outrageous claim.”

Also looking forward to an accounting and a judgment is Louis, who’s still fuming 15 months later about falling asleep with his family and waking up with his back broken, being told he’d beat his wife.

“On a work site,” he says, if a storm is coming and the winds get above 25 miles per hour, you get everyone off the roof to keep them safe and, in the process, ensure your own bottom line. How is it that cops,” he asks, “are held to such a lower bar?”

He’s furious that the department’s new body-camera program hadn’t rolled out when the police showed up at his door. About how, if he loses the suit, he may have to pay the department’s legal fees. “They have the nerve to do this. That’s intimidation. That’s bullshit.”

And he’s worried about his sex life—“I’m an Italian guy from Queens who was in a body cast. It is what it is, and it isn’t good”—while Szilvia’s worried about his health and earnings to support Marco and, she hopes, his future siblings.

The legal issue here is a much narrower one, says Falkoff, Louis’ lawyer, “focused on the amount of force they used in arresting him and the perceptions of the officers as it’s unfolding. This wasn’t 20 minutes but 15 or 20 seconds. EMS tells the cops to get in there fast, because they see the wife bleeding and Louis out of it. Cops get there and maybe it’s reasonable to take Louis down to the floor when he doesn’t respond. It’s the amount of force they used to take him down that’s the issue here.”

For Louis, it comes down to right and wrong.

“I never, ever beat anybody up, been drunk in public, had any issue with the police, done anything. I live for my son and my wife, my family, and I work hard. I don’t expect this to happen to me or anybody for that matter.

“How is it that no one can say, ‘We’re sorry and that was wrong’?”

“It’s insane. I have to see doctors and a physical therapist and also someone for PTSD now. I’m back at work, but I can’t talk about it with anyone there. There’s no support group for this. And when I tell my black friend, he just says ‘that’s how it is.’

“That’s not right. That’s not how it should be. I’m trying to tell white people: They’re coming for you, too, bro.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        LARGO — Police say the father whose 8-month-old was left in a bedroom with no air conditioning was told the day before the infant's death to keep his children in another room.

William Francis Hendrickson, 25, now faces several charges after police found his son lifeless in a playpen on Thursday.

The bedroom at the S Belcher Road mobile home was 109 degrees when police arrived. The baby's body temperature was 105.6 degrees and Hendrickson's daughter, 2, was immediately sent to Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital for dehydration, according to a police affidavit.

Police said they performed CPR on the boy until paramedics arrived. The infant could not be resuscitated and died at the scene.

Meanwhile, the children's mother sat in a jail cell, arrested days earlier on a battery charge.

About 12:30 p.m. on Thursday, Largo police officers responded to assist Pinellas County Child Protection investigators with a welfare check on the two children at the King's Manor Estates mobile home park at 1399 S Belcher Rd. lot 112.

Child services had told the father the day before not to leave the children in the bedroom, police said, but Hendrickson said he had "no where else to go" after his girlfriend was arrested the week before on charges she fought with his mother.

"He kept the children confined in the bedroom with him to avoid his live-in parents," police wrote.

On Saturday, the children's mother, Elizabeth Michelle Rutenbeck, 24, was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of battery. According to an arrest report, Rutenbeck tried to force her way into Hendrickson's mother's bedroom in the mobile home.

"The defendant then pushed through the victim to get an Xbox from inside the victim's room," the report says.

Rutenbeck was booked into the Pinellas County jail. Already on probation for felony charges of grand theft, she is being held without bail.

Two days later, Hendrickson's mother, Carrie Hendrickson, filed a domestic violence petition against Rutenbeck. She identified Rutenbeck as her son's "baby mama." In it, Carrie Hendrickson wrote that Rutenbeck injured her neck and knee and that a door she damaged needs to be replaced.

"All her belongings need to be removed from premises," she wrote.

On Friday at 10 a.m., detectives knocked on the mobile home's door. The woman who answered barked, "My grandson is dead because you did not do your job," before allowing them inside.

Hendrickson faces charges of aggravated child neglect for the condition of his daughter and aggravated manslaughter in the death of his son, according to police. He has had no arrests prior to Thursday in Florida, records show.

Police said citizens need to be reminded of the dangers of Florida's scorching temperatures, particularly in confined or poorly ventilated spaces and "especially for children, the elderly, and those with special medical concerns."

Hendrickson was booked into Pinellas County Jail on Thursday night and is being held on $150,000 bail.

Mike Bobbitt has lived one lot down from the Hendrickson's cream colored and red-trimmed home for 15 years.

Shepherd's House grant denied

VA mute as to reason; director of homeless vets center stunned

BRIAN FRANCISCO | The Journal Gazette

Shepherd's House, a Fort Wayne faith-based organization that provides transitional housing�for homeless military veterans, might launch a community fund drive, curtail�its services or close its doors because of the pending loss of federal funds.

Shepherd's House co-founder Barb Cox said Thursday that the Department of Veterans Affairs apparently has denied its application for a grant worth about $496,000 a year. A similar grant has�accounted for the bulk�of the organization's $622,000 yearly budget, with the rest coming from private sources.

“We're just completely thrown for a loop, honestly,” Cox said in a telephone interview.

“We've given everything for this ministry for the last�20 years, and we've seen miracle after miracle. ... I can't even let my mind ponder God not moving and making this possible again,” she said.

Shepherd's House has�40 beds for VA-qualified homeless veterans at its Tennessee Avenue building�near Spy Run. It has been receiving grant money since 2009 through VA's�Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program, called GPD for short. The grant amounts to $46 a day for each veteran served.

VA announced�in December that it would terminate�GPD�grants dating back to 1994 and�require recipients to reapply for funding by April 4.�VA said in its termination notice that it would turn the GPD into a competitive, performance-based yearly grant program.�Existing grants expire Sept.�30, and funds�will run out Dec.�31.

“We were told clearly�that 97 percent of all the existing programs would be funded, and we knew we couldn't fall in that (remaining) 3 percent because we're not just a cot and a meal, we've got a huge clinical treatment program here,” Cox said about Shepherd's House.

She said judges from a half-dozen court systems “will only refer here, because this program is so good. I never expected not to be funded.”

Cox said she�has never received written�notice from VA that the Shepherd's House grant application had been�rejected. She said she called a VA employee�in Tampa, Florida, to ask about the application and was told, “Oh, it's not good.”

VA officials in Washington, D.C., had not responded to requests for comment by Thursday night.

Liberty Landing, a transitional housing complex for homeless veterans on South Calhoun Street, received word that�its GPD application�had been approved, according to its owner, faith-based�Volunteers of America of Indiana. Mike Lloyd, vice president of operations for the Indianapolis-based Volunteers,�said�he did not know how much VA money the�40-bed facility would receive.

Asked about the future of Shepherd's House without federal funds, Cox said�one prospect is “really, really scaling back”�medical, psychological and other services for homeless veterans.�Another option is asking for�financial contributions from Fort Wayne�organizations, foundations and residents.

“I'm praying that the community steps up�and somehow makes this go on,” she said.

Asked whether�closing is an option, Cox said: “Well, we're 30,000 square feet. You can't make an operation this big continue without funding. So I don't want to say those words out loud, but I mean, it's just obvious.”

Rep. Jim Banks, R-3rd, wrote�a letter Wednesday to VA Secretary David Shulkin seeking details on the agency's decision to deny GPD funding to Shepherd's House. He wrote�that “to date no official explanation for this decision has been provided.”

Banks, a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, noted in his letter that Cox and her husband, Shepherd's House co-founder Lonnie Cox, received�Indiana's highest civilian honor, the Sagamore of the Wabash, from�then-Gov. Mike Pence, now the nation's vice president, in 2016.

While applauding VA efforts to improve its services for homeless veterans, Banks added,�“In the wake of these changes, organizations are running out of time to navigate a course for the future.” He wrote�that Indianapolis-based Hoosier Veteran Assistance Foundation did not get an official explanation for a reduction in its�GPD funding.

Banks is�not the only member of Congress�trying to get answers. The Journal Times of Racine County, Wisconsin, reported last week that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis.,�have�written to�Shulkin�to ask why their state's veterans affairs agency�has lost a $500,000 federal VA grant for aiding homeless veterans.

VA said last year on its website that the GPD has supported more than 600 homeless veterans projects and 13,800 beds nationwide. The program served roughly 44,700 homeless veterans in fiscal 2016, with more than 16,500 of them finding permanent housing, according to the website.

The�VA notice to terminate grants stated that�the agency “expects to fund 24 existing service centers and 12,000 beds” under its new plan, in which grants would fit�five housing models. Shepherd's House had applied under the clinical and hospital-to-housing models, while Liberty Landing applied under bridge housing for short stays and service-intensive transitioning.�

The December VA notice stated�that “the�allocation of these grants needs to be�updated to reflect the documented�current need as well as to increase the�flexibility to adapt to future needs.”

The nation's homeless veteran population declined�by nearly 50�percent�between�2010�and 2016, when it was about 39,400,�according to federal estimates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “The State is ordered to comply with the DEA’s administrative subpoena within 21 days of issuance of this Order or face contempt sanctions upon motion made by the DEA,” U.S. District Court Judge David Nuffer wrote in the order.

The Utah Attorney General’s Office told FOX 13 on Friday it was reviewing the opinion and any potential options for appeal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    If approved, the rate increase would be phased in over two years. The first increase would occur in the summer of 2018 and the full rate would go into affect in early 2019. I&M says a residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month would see an increase of less than $1 per day.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration the average Indiana household averaged 964 kilowatt hours per month in 2015.

“I&M’s plan prepares the company for a future of energy generation that is more diverse and will allow us to offer our customers new, cleaner energy options. The plan will improve customers’ service through investments in infrastructure that will reduce outages and directly limit service interruptions caused by severe weather,” said Toby Thomas, President and Chief Operating Officer of I&M. “We intend to better serve our communities by renovating aging equipment, modernizing the delivery system with new technology and improving the reliability of service while being mindful of the cost impacts on our customers.”

The Building the Future program would also allow the utility to create a systematic, four-year tree trimming program. I&M says the number one source of customer outages is trees and other vegetation.

If approved, the rate increase would give I&M an additional $263 million a year in revenue.

I&M asked for a rate increase in 2011 but was only awarded about half of its proposal by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

Also, I&M wants to increase the minimum customer charge, also called a fixed charge. That increase would go from $7.30 to $18. The minimum charge increase would be on top of the base rate increase.
